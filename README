1. Documentation
================

TE has two types of documentation.

1. Autogenerated doxygen documentation. Is built with

$ ./gen_doxygen

script which is located in the top directory. Most of doxygen versions you
can find in real life are supported.

The documentation can be then found at doc/generated/html/

Doxygen warnings can be found in ./doxygen.warn file.

Some pictures require 'ditaa' to be installed.

2. Static documents. Can be found in doc/ folder. May be outdated -- check
doxygen documentation first.

2. Build
========

TE build is described in details in the generated documentation.

First thing to do:

export TE_BASE=<TE SOURCES DIR>

Briefly:
  * if you build standalone TE (no external test suite) you should call
    $ ./dispatcher.sh
    and wait till the buid is complete;
  * if you build a test suite -- go there and execute
    $ ./run.sh
    which will do pretty much the same as dispatcher.sh, but also build the
    test suite libraries and tests.

2.1 Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dependencies are described in details in the generated documentation of
TE build and test suite.


2.2 External libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

External libraries may be specified by TE_EXT_LIBS macro in builder.conf
(see comments to macro in engine/builder/builder.m4).

TE_EXT_LIB enviroment variable should be set to
http://oktetlabs.ru/~tester/te.

External libraries should be placed to
http://oktetlabs.ru/~tester/te/<platform>,
e.g. http://oktetlabs.ru/~tester/te/i686-pc-linux-gnu.

Labraries should be *.tgz archieves that may contain lib/ and include/
directories. They are simply unpacked to installation directory of the
corresponding platform.

BASH-completion
===============

If you want to use BASH-completion with TE scripts, add in your
~/.bash_completion file or any appropriate place:

complete -F _configure_func $default ./dispatcher.sh ./run.sh
