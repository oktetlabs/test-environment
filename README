Required packages:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following packages are required to build and run.

Engine:

- libxml2-devel at least 2.6.x (2.6.10)
- glib2-devel (glib-2.0 package we use 2.4.8)
- popt-devel (libpopt-dev on Debian)
- tcl (and tcl-devel, if applicable, e.g. on Fedora Core 2)
- libxslt (we use 1.1.6)
- libexpat
- flex >= 2.5.31-31 from sourceforge; flex 2.5.4a from gnu.org will not work
- gawk (mawk will not work)
- any curses library (ncurses will work) with development files

Test Agent:

- expect and expect-dev (for TAD CLI only)
- libnetlink + iproute/ headers
- flex >= 2.5.31-31 from sourceforge; flex 2.5.4a from gnu.org will not work
- libexpat
- libpcap0.8-dev (for TAD PCAP only)

We are using versions of libraries specified in parentheses.

Of course, gcc, make, sed and other standard development tools
are required to build sources.

To control DHCP daemon using OMAPI from Linux TA DHCP development
package is required (dhcp3-dev on Debian, dhcp-devel on RedHat and
Fedora Core). On Debian dhcp3-dev package should be rebuild to have
libdst.a library.


Tools required for development:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following tools are required for development, but not required
to build and run from distributive:

- autoconf (at least 2.59)
- automake (at least 1.8)
- pkg-config (on Debian) or pkgconfig (on RedHat or FC)
- libtool


Supported OSes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All works fine with Debian 3.1 (Sarge) native packages.

For Fedora Core 3, you need to install new flex (we use package from PLD
distribution) and netlink library (we use home-made iproute rpm which
includes the library).

If you know success stories/problems for other Linux/*BSD/* distributions,
add your comments here.


BASH-completion:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to use BASH-completion with TE scripts, add in your
~/.bash_completion file or any appropriate place:

complete -F _configure_func $default ./dispatcher.sh ./run.sh
