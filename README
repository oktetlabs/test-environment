#################################

OKTET Labs Test Environment (TE) is a software product that is intended to
ease creating automated test suites. The history of TE goes back to 2000
year when the first prototype of software was created. At that time the
product was used for testing SNMP MIBs and CLI commands. Two years later (in
2002) software was extended to support testing of IPv6 protocol.

1. Documentation
================

TE has two types of documentation.

1. Autogenerated doxygen documentation. Is built with

$ ./gen_doxygen

script which is located in the top directory. Most of doxygen versions you
can find in real life are supported.

The documentation can be then found at doc/generated/html/

Doxygen warnings can be found in ./doxygen.warn file.

Some pictures require 'ditaa' to be installed.

2. Static documents. Can be found in doc/ folder. May be outdated -- check
doxygen documentation first.

2. Build
========

TE build is described in details in the generated documentation.

First thing to do:

export TE_BASE=<TE SOURCES DIR>

Briefly:
  * if you build standalone TE (no external test suite) you should call
    $ ./dispatcher.sh
    and wait till the buid is complete;
  * if you build a test suite -- go there and execute
    $ ./run.sh
    which will do pretty much the same as dispatcher.sh, but also build the
    test suite libraries and tests.

2.1 Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dependencies are described in details in the generated documentation of
TE build and test suite.


2.2 External libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

External libraries may be specified by TE_EXT_LIBS macro in builder.conf
(see comments to macro in engine/builder/builder.m4).

TE_EXT_LIB enviroment variable should be set to
http://oktetlabs.ru/~tester/te.

External libraries should be placed to
http://oktetlabs.ru/~tester/te/<platform>,
e.g. http://oktetlabs.ru/~tester/te/i686-pc-linux-gnu.

Labraries should be *.tgz archieves that may contain lib/ and include/
directories. They are simply unpacked to installation directory of the
corresponding platform.

BASH-completion
===============

If you want to use BASH-completion with TE scripts, add in your
~/.bash_completion file or any appropriate place:

complete -F _configure_func $default ./dispatcher.sh ./run.sh
