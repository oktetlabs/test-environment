Required packages:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following packages are required to build and run.

NOTE: for building TE you need to have:
 - autoconf 2.61
 - automake 1.9.6 (note: 1.10.* does not work)

Engine (in [] brackets - debian package names):

- libxml2-devel at least 2.6.x (2.6.10) [libxml2 libxml2-dev]
- glib2-devel (glib-2.0 package we use 2.4.8) [libglib2-dev]
- popt-devel (libpopt-dev on Debian) [libpopt-dev]
- libreadline (for tester interactive) [libreadline-common,
  libreadline-dev, libreadline-5]
- tcl (and tcl-devel, if applicable, e.g. on Fedora Core 2) [tcl, tcl-dev]
- libxslt (we use 1.1.6) [libxslt1-dev, libxslt-1.1]
- libexpat [libexpat1, libexpat1-dev]
- flex >= 2.5.31-31 from sourceforge; flex 2.5.4a from
  gnu.org will not work [flex]
- gawk (mawk will not work) [gawk]
- any curses library (ncurses will work) with development
  files [ncurses, ncurses-dev]
- perl-Time-HiRes package on Redhat/Fedora is very usefull (it allows to
  avoid mixture in log because of unprecise timestamps in messages
  logged by Dispatcher (via logging script))
- libgss0 (>=0.0.18) [libgss0]
- Wireless tools - development files [libiw-dev]
- PPPoE [pppoe] [pppoeconf]
- curl libraries [not from debian, should be taken from storage]
- libusb, libusb-dev
- libpam0g-dev
- libperl-dev
- bison

We've tested engine on Linux only.


Unix Test Agent:

- expect and expect-dev (for TAD CLI only) [expect, expect-dev]
- flex >= 2.5.31 from sourceforge; flex 2.5.4a from gnu.org does not work
- libexpat
- libpcap0.8-dev (for TAD PCAP only) [libpcap0.8-dev]
- libpam (0.76-22) (not required but suggested) [libpam]
- libnl-devel

We are using versions of libraries specified in parentheses.

Windows Test Agent (engine on windows is not supported):

- cygwin cross-toolchain
- libpcap (crosscompiled for cygwin). Should be put into standard
  include/lib paths of cygwin cross-compiler - required for TAD library.
  Winpcap runtime has to be installed on Windows host.

Of course, gcc, make, sed and other standard development tools
are required to build sources.

External libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

External libraries may be specified by TE_EXT_LIBS macro in builder.conf
(see comments to macro in engine/builder/builder.m4).

TE_EXT_LIB enviroment variable should be set to 
http://oktetlabs.ru/~tester/te.

External libraries should be placed to 
http://oktetlabs.ru/~tester/te/<platform>,
e.g. http://oktetlabs.ru/~tester/te/i686-pc-linux-gnu.

Labraries should be *.tgz archieves that may contain lib/ and include/ 
directories. They are simply unpacked to installation directory of the 
corresponding platform.

Tools required for development:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following tools are required for development, but not required
to build and run from distributive:

- autoconf (at least 2.59)
- automake (at least 1.9.4)
- pkg-config (on Debian) or pkgconfig (on RedHat or FC)
- libtool


Supported OSes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Linux:
All works fine with Debian 3.1 (Sarge) native packages.
For Fedora Core, you need to install new flex (we use package from PLD
distribution).

Solaris:
Test agent is tested with OpenSolaris SunOS thorin 5.11 snv_59, both i86
and amd64 architecture.
For cross-tools, you need to install libdlpi and all dependent libraries.

Windows:
Test agent works on Windows with cygwin core and cygwin ssh server
installed.

If you know success stories/problems for other Linux/*BSD/* distributions,
add your comments here.


BASH-completion:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to use BASH-completion with TE scripts, add in your
~/.bash_completion file or any appropriate place:

complete -F _configure_func $default ./dispatcher.sh ./run.sh
