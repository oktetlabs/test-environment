The flag characters (see 'man 3 printf') should be supported by
logger and report generator (#,0,-,<space>,+).

Logger should regornize corresponding format as argument and pass
it throught logger internal interfaces to raw log file.

The first argument (TA name) of the following functions:
    rcf_ta_csap_destroy   rcf_ta_csap_param
    rcf_ta_trsend_start   rcf_ta_trsend_stop
    rcf_ta_trrecv_start   rcf_ta_trrecv_stop
    rcf_ta_trrecv_get     rcf_ta_trsend_recv
should be removed. Agent name is passed as an argument of rcf_ta_csap_create
function and it's better to keep this value inside csap control block.

It's better to use 'csap_handle_t' data type insted of 'int' as a type of 
CSAP handle (It makes the code more portable).

Configurator does not support "read-write" objects for branches other 
than "/agent".

It should be possible to write in configurator.conf something like
the following:

<register>
  <object oid="/net" access="read_create" type="none"/>
</register>
<register>
  <object oid="/net/type" access="read_write" type="integer"/>
</register>

<add>
  <instance oid="/net:net_A"/>
</add>
<set>
  <instance oid="/net:net_A/type:" value="10"/>
</set>

API SNMP:
Absence of net-snmp library installed in the system should be reported 
on the package configuring step, not on compiling state.
