@section introduction Introduction

<!--
  - Provide introductory descriptive information about context and
  - purpose of the document, allowing reader to better understand
  - its meaning.
  -
  - Identify test plan document, if it exists, in which conditions this
  - specification was written.
  -
  - Any general information, which should be provided before another
  - sections, may be written here.
  -
  - State briefly what this Test Specification covers.
  -->



@subsection constrains What is tested and will not be tested

<!--
  - List identifiers of the requirements directly verified by this Test
  - Specification. If requirement is partly tested, mark out the aspects
  - to be verified by this Test Specification and not to be verified.
  - Try to provide reasons why some aspect/feature is not tested.
  -->


@subsection quality_goals Quality goals

<!--
  - Specify the quality goals:
  -  - code coverage (in percents);
  -  - compatibility;
  -  - reliability in normal use;
  -  - boundary value testing;
  -  - robustness under stress;
  -  - performance.

@section applicability_constrains Applicability Constrains

<!-- The last two subsections may be omitted for black box testing. -->


@subsection environmental_requirements Environmental Requirements

<!--
  - Specify configuration(s) necessary to use this Test Specification.
  -
  - If different configurations are necessary for different tests,
  - it's recommended to describe all configurations here and structure
  - tests by used configuration. Also it's possible to describe
  - configurations in the package description file, if many
  - configurations must be tested with small number of tests for each
  - configuration.
  -
  - Also static target configuration (software) must be described here.
  -
  - In fact it's rarely when each test uses all configuration items.
  - Hence some of them may be marked as optional with AC-ER-<number>
  - identifier to be referenced from detailed description of packages
  - and tests.
  -->

@subsection target_configure Target configure

<!--
  - Specify necessary capabilities to configure target dynamically.
  - Each item must have identifier AC-TC-<number> to be referenced
  - in Tests Specification below.
  -->



@section specification Test Specification

<!--
  - Test identifier must contain only letters [a..zA..Z], numbers [0..9]
  - and underscore '_'. Symbol '-' is used to divided identifier into
  - parent test identifier and local subtest identifier. Local subtest
  - identifier must not contain it.
  -
  - Provide reference to the root of the described here test package.
