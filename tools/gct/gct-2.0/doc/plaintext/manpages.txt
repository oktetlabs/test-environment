DESCRIPTION
     gct is a generic coverage tool for C programs. It implements
     branch  coverage,  multi-condition  coverage, loop coverage,
     weak mutation coverage, and more.   This  description  is  a
     brief  summary;  see the User's Manual and _A _T_u_t_o_r_i_a_l _I_n_t_r_o_-
     _d_u_c_t_i_o_n _t_o _G_C_T for details.

     The tool works as a preprocessor for  C  source  files.   It
     parses  the  source, adds code to test whether the program's
     execution satisfies certain _c_o_v_e_r_a_g_e _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_s, then passes
     the instrumented program to the C compiler.  GCT also writes
     a _m_a_p _f_i_l_e which describes the meaning and location of  each
     of  the  coverage  conditions.   The  executable,  when run,
     writes a _l_o_g _f_i_l_e.  greport(1) is then  used  to  see  which
     coverage  conditions  have  yet to be satisfied.  More tests
     are then written in the hopes  of  satisfying  the  coverage
     conditions.

     The _c_o_n_t_r_o_l _f_i_l_e is used to control GCT.   Control  is  very
     flexible and extensive;  see the user documentation.

     gct normally uses  cc  to  compile  the  instrumented  code.
     GCT's  installer  may  have  also created shell scripts that
     cause GCT to use different C compilers.   Such  scripts  are
     normally  named  gct-_c_o_m_p_i_l_e_r_n_a_m_e.   Using the control file,
     you may also tell GCT not to invoke any  compiler;  this  is
     useful  when  the  instrumented  code is to be compiled on a
     different machine.

     gct is actually a shell script that invokes the true execut-
     able,  gct.exec,  with  whatever  options are needed for the
     system's C compiler.

OPTIONS
     These options, when passed to gct, will be passed  along  to
     gct.exec.

     -test-dir _m_a_s_t_e_r__d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
          Specifies the _m_a_s_t_e_r _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y where the map file  will
          be  stored  and  where  gct expects to find the control
          file. The default is the current directory. If you work
          with hierarchical makefiles that invoke other makefiles

          in other directories, this option must be used.

     -test-control _c_o_n_t_r_o_l__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e
          This option changes the default name  for  the  control
          file  from  "gct-ctrl"  to some other name.  Unless the
          argument is an absolute pathname, it  is  taken  to  be
          relative to the master directory.

     -test-map _m_a_p__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e
          This option changes the default name for the  map  file
          from "gct-map" to some other name.  Unless the argument
          is an absolute pathname, it is taken to be relative  to
          the master directory.

     -test-cc _a_l_t_e_r_n_a_t_e__c_o_m_p_i_l_e_r
          Tell GCT to use _a_l_t_e_r_n_a_t_e__c_o_m_p_i_l_e_r.  The default is cc.

     -test-nolink
          This tells GCT not to link executables when it normally
          would. gct-remap is not executed.

     -test-traditional
          Tell gct.exec to treat the program  as  traditional  C,
          not  ANSI  C.  The gcc script will normally set this if
          it's  needed.   The  meaning  of  -test-traditional  is
          identical  to  that  of gcc's -traditional option.  See
          the gcc(1) manpage (delivered with GCT).   The  -tradi-
          tional  option  may also be used, but it will be passed
          to any  C  compiler  GCT  invokes,  which  may  not  be
          appropriate.

     In addition to these options, gct accepts  all  the  options
     that  gcc  version  1.37  does  - that is, a superset of the
     options commonly accepted by C compilers.  See  gcc(1).   In
     addition  to  obeying the options itself - if relevant - GCT
     passes options not beginning with "-test" to any compiler it
     invokes.

CONTROL FILE EXAMPLES
     These are intended to be a quick  reminder  of  the  syntax.
     See the User's Guide for complete details.

NAME
     greport - report on execution of a program  instrumented  by
     gct.

SYNOPSIS
     greport [ -l ] [ -n  ]  [  -test-dir  _m_a_s_t_e_r__d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y  ]  [

     _l_o_g__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e ]

DESCRIPTION
     greport uses the map file and the  log  file  to  produce  a
     report  on the test execution that resulted in the log file.
     The report contains information about conditions  that  have
     not  yet  been fully tested.  The map file is created during
     the instrumentation of the source code by gct.  The log file
     is usually written by gct_writelog() during a test run.  The
     map file is named _g_c_t-_m_a_p by default.  The log file is given
     as  the  single  argument.  If no log file is given, greport
     reads from standard input.

     The resulting report looks like the output of a  C  compiler
     and  can  be  used with error(1) or the GNU Emacs next-error
     function.  The complete output format is described  in  _G_e_n_-
     _e_r_i_c _C_o_v_e_r_a_g_e _T_o_o_l (_G_C_T) _D_o_c_u_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n.

     Example:

          host-1% greport test3_log
          "lc.c", line 247: if was taken TRUE 0, FALSE 3 times.
          "lc.c", line 268: operand i might be constant.
          "lc.c", line 568: loop zero times: 0S, one time: 0, many times: 1551.

     This report shows that a branching statement was never taken
     true,  a  particular  reference  to  the  variable  I always
     yielded the same  value,  and  a  loop  was  never  executed
     exactly  one  or  exactly  zero times.  The "0S" in the last
     case indicates that the user has suppressed  this  condition
     with gedit(1) -- the loop can never execute zero times.

     If another test is run that causes the if to be taken in the
     TRUE  direction,  a  later report will not display the first
     line.  If that test also causes  the  loop  to  execute  one
     time,  the last line will not be shown, even though the loop
     never executed zero times.

OPTIONS
     -test-dir _m_a_s_t_e_r__d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
          The _m_a_s_t_e_r _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is  the  directory  where  all  of
          gct's  data  files  are  kept.   By  default, it is the

GREPORT(1)               USER COMMANDS                 GREPORT(1)



          current directory.  This option changes the default.

     -test-map _m_a_p__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e
          By default, information about  coverage  conditions  is
          found  in  the  file "gct-map" in the master directory.
          This option changes the default.  Unless  the  argument
          is  an absolute pathname, it is taken to be relative to
          the master directory.

     -l   Normally, greport prints file  names  relative  to  the
          master directory.  Given this option, it prints them as
          absolute pathnames.

     -all greport will display the values for all coverage condi-
          tions,  satisfied  or  no.   Such  a display might look
          like:

          "test.c", line 3: operator < might be <=. (L==R) [0]
          "test.c", line 4: while was taken TRUE 1, FALSE 1 times.
          "test.c", line 4: loop zero times: 0S, one time: 1, many times: 0.
          "test.c", line 4: operand argc might be constant.  [1]

          For output lines that don't  normally  include  counts,
          the  number  of times a condition has been satisfied is
          given in trailing brackets.

     -show-ignored
          Normally, greport does not display lines you've ignored
          (with  either  gedit(1) or by manually editing the map-
          file).  If this option  is  given,  ignored  lines  are
          displayed;  this is mainly useful for reviewing earlier
          decisions to ignore when nearing the  end  of  testing.
          In  the  output,  ignored counts are suffixed with "I".
          Note that this option does not imply -all.  To  distin-
          guish  between  ignoring  done  with gedit and ignoring
          done by manually editing the  mapfile,  use  the  -edit
          option.   The  editing  portion of the output describes
          only the edits to that line.

     -n   This option causes greport to  show  only  those  lines
          with  counts greater than zero.  This is most useful in
          a pipeline like this:

          % gnewer -logical log later-log | greport -n

          which gives a detailed report on what new coverage  was
          added  between _l_o_g and _l_a_t_e_r-_l_o_g.  The output format is
          the same as -all.  Suppression is ignored.

     -edit
          If this option is given, greport's output is in a  for-
          mat  that can be edited and used as gedit's input.  See

          gedit(1) for details.

     -visible-file

     -vf  These two options are synonyms.  They may  be  repeated
          to  name several files.  If given, greport reports only
          on coverage conditions within the  named  files.   This
          option  overrides  any file editing inside the mapfile.
          Editing still applies to routines contained within  the
          file, as well as to included files.  If, for example, a
          routine is ignored, it remains ignored.

          The argument to the option is actually  an  ed(1)-style
          regular expression, which is often useful for selecting
          subsets of a mapfile.  For example,

               % greport -vf "dir1/.*"

          Produces a report on the contents of directory _d_i_r_1.  A
          simple  shell  script  can place per-directory (or per-
          file) reports thoughout a directory hierarchy.

     -visible-routine

     -vr  greport reports only on coverage conditions within  the
          named  routines.   These  options ignore any routine or
          file editing inside the mapfile.  Editing still applies
          to  lines  within the routine.  Edits to included files
          also still apply; this is inconsistent, but often  use-
          ful.

          Like -vf, the argument can  be  a  regular  expression.
          These  options  may  also  be repeated, and they can be
          combined with -vf.  In that case, a line  in  either  a
          visible file or a visible routine is shown.

EXAMPLES
     See _A _T_u_t_o_r_i_a_l _I_n_t_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n _t_o _G_C_T.

BUGS
     The visible-routine/vr option applies to all  routines  with
     the  same  name;  use  grep  to  filter out files that don't
     interest you.

     Because -vf and -vr work by ignoring all non-matching  files
     or routines, the -show-ignored option negates their effects.

     gsummary - summary report on execution of a program  instru-
     mented by gct.

SYNOPSIS

         [ -files | -f ] [ -routines | -r ] [ _l_o_g__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e ]

DESCRIPTION
     gsummary uses the map file and log file to produce a summary
     report.   The map file is created during the instrumentation
     of the source code by gct.  The log file is usually  written
     by gct_writelog() during a test run.  The map file's default
     name is _g_c_t-_m_a_p.  The log file is given as the single  argu-
     ment.  If no log file is given, gsummary reads from standard
     input.

     The resulting report looks like this:

          ernie-5% gsummary LOG

          BINARY BRANCH INSTRUMENTATION (76 conditions total)
          3 ( 3.95%) not satisfied.

          SWITCH INSTRUMENTATION (14 conditions total)
          0 ( 0.00%) not satisfied.
          14 (100.00%) fully satisfied.

          MULTIPLE CONDITION INSTRUMENTATION (38 conditions total)
          2 ( 5.26%) not satisfied.
          36 (94.74%) fully satisfied.

          OPERATOR INSTRUMENTATION (27 conditions total)
          1 ( 3.70%) not satisfied.

          10 ( 5.59%) not satisfied.
          169 (94.41%) fully satisfied.

     This report shows that three branch  directions  were  never
     taken,  all  cases (including default) were taken, four loop
     execution conditions were not satisfied, and so on.

GSUMMARY(1)              USER COMMANDS                GSUMMARY(1)



     In cases where the user  suppressed  some  conditions  using
     gedit(1), the contribution of the suppressed conditions will
     be given in brackets, like this:

     BINARY BRANCH INSTRUMENTATION (76 conditions total)
     0 ( 0.00%) not satisfied.
     76 (100.00%) fully satisfied. [2 ( 2.63%) suppressed]

     In this case, two branch directions were manually suppressed
     (presumably because they are impossible to exercise).

OPTIONS
     -visible-file

     -vf  These two options are synonyms.  They may  be  repeated
          to name several files.  If given, gsummary reports only
          on coverage conditions within the named  files.   These
          options  ignore  any  file  editing inside the mapfile.
          Editing still applies to routines contained within  the
          file, as well as to included files.  If, for example, a
          routine is ignored, it remains ignored

          The argument to the option is actually  an  ed(1)-style
          regular expression, which is often useful for selecting
          subsets of a mapfile.  For example,

               % gsummary -files -vf "dir1/.*"

          Produces a per-file summary for the directory  _d_i_r_1.  A
          simple  shell  script  can  be  used to place summaries
          throughout a directory hierarchy.

     -visible-routine

     -vr  gsummary reports only on coverage conditions within the
          named  routines.   This option overrides any routine or
          file editing inside the mapfile.  Editing still applies
          to  lines  within the routine.  Edits to included files
          also still apply; this is inconsistent, but often  use-
          ful.

          Like -vf, the argument can  be  a  regular  expression.
          These  options  may  also  be repeated, and they can be
          combined with -vf.  In that case, a line  in  either  a
          visible  file  or a visible routine is used when calcu-
          lating the summary.

     -files

     -f   Terse per-file summaries are printed instead of a grand
          summary.  Each line summarizes a single file.  The line
          format is designed so that  gsummary's  output  can  be

          used  by tools like awk(1) and sort(1).  A line of out-
          put might look like this:

          gcc.c         77=ALL  78=BR  50=SW  67=LP  76=ML  81=<  260#

          The first numeric entry is the total percentage of cov-
          erage  conditions satisfied for the file. The next five
          numeric entries give the percent satisfied  for branch,
          switch,  loop,  multicondition, and relational operator
          coverage. The final entry is  the  number  of  coverage
          conditions.  The  tags  are terse to try to fit all the
          information in 80 columns.

          Routine instrumentation uses the tag "ROUT", call  uses
          "CALL",  race uses "RACE", operand uses "x", and opera-
          tor uses "<".  (The last is not a typo  -  recall  that
          relational coverage is really a kind of operator cover-
          age.)

     -routines

     -r   Terse per-routine summaries are printed.  The format is
          the same as for the -files option.

     -test-dir _m_a_s_t_e_r__d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
          The _m_a_s_t_e_r _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is  the  directory  where  all  of
          gct's  data  files  are  kept.   By  default, it is the
          current directory.  This option changes the default.

     -test-map _m_a_p__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e
          By default, information about  coverage  conditions  is
          found  in  the  file "gct-map" in the master directory.
          This option changes the default.  Unless  the  argument
          is  an absolute pathname, it is taken to be relative to
          the master directory.

EXAMPLES

     This command prints the summaries for the five source  files
     with the lowest coverage:

     This command prints the same summaries, but  this  time  for

INCLUDED FILES
     If you use the  instrument-included-files option in the con-
     trol  file,  you  need to know how gsummary handles included
     files.

     The argument to -visible-file  is  always  a  main  filename
     (such  as  appears  in  the control file), never an included
     file.  There is no way to get a per-include-file summary.

     The -files  option  summarizes  an  entire  file,  including
     instrumented routines from included files.

     If a routine comes from  an  included  file,  the  -routines
     option  will  note  both  the main filename and the included
     filename.

NAME
     gedit - manually suppress gct coverage conditions

SYNOPSIS
     gedit   [   -test-dir   _m_a_s_t_e_r__d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y   ]   [   -test-map
     _m_a_p__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e ] [ -v ] [ _r_e_p_o_r_t__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e ]

DESCRIPTION
     gedit modifies the map file to control what  greport(1)  and
     gsummary(1)  display.  To use gedit, you must first create a
     report file using greport -edit:

     % greport -edit GCTLOG > REPORT

     This report looks like:

     "test.c", line 3: [0: 1 0] if was taken TRUE 1, FALSE 0 times.
     "test.c", line 3: [1: 0] operator < might be <=.
     "test.c", line 3: [2: 1 0] condition 1 (argc, 1) was taken TRUE 1, FALSE 0 times.
     "test.c", line 3: [3: 0 0] condition 2 (argc, 1) was taken TRUE 0, FALSE 0 times.

     Each line represents one or more coverage conditions.   (For
     example,  a  branch  represents  two:  one that requires the
     branch to be taken TRUE, and one that requires the branch to
     be  taken FALSE.)  The text of interest is in brackets.  The
     number before the colon is irrelevant to the user; it is the
     index for the first of that line's coverage conditions.  The
     numbers after the colon show how often the respective condi-
     tions  were  satisfied.   For example, in the case of the if
     statement, the TRUE condition was  satisfied  once  and  the
     FALSE condition never.  The operator condition was satisfied
     zero times.

     If a condition is impossible to satisfy,  you  may  want  to
     tell greport not to display information about it, even if no
     test case has ruled it out.  The first step in doing this is
     to  suppress the condition by replacing its number by an "S"
     or "s".  You can also add the "S"  or  "s"  to  the  number.
     Here is an example:

     "test.c", line 3: [0: 1 0S] if was taken TRUE 1, FALSE 0 times.
     "test.c", line 3: [1: 0s] operator < might be <=.
     "test.c", line 3: [2: 1 s] condition 1 (argc, 1) was taken TRUE 1, FALSE 0 times.
     "test.c", line 3: [3: 0 S] condition 2 (argc, 1) was taken TRUE 0, FALSE 0 times.

     By doing this, you have declared that you do not want to see
     the  first  three  lines  again  --  all the conditions have
     either been satisfied by a test or suppressed  by  you.  You
     want  the fourth line to be shown until the condition evalu-
     ates TRUE.

GEDIT(1)                 USER COMMANDS                   GEDIT(1)



     To cause your changes to take effect, run  gedit.   It  will
     modify the mapfile.

     % gedit REPORT

     or

     % gedit < REPORT

     From this point on, greport will treat suppressed conditions
     as  if  they'd been satisfied.  The output from greport will
     look like:

     "test.c", line 3: condition 2 (argc, 1) was taken TRUE 0, FALSE 0S times.

     Notice that the FALSE case has been tagged with an S.  gsum-
     mary  will  treat suppressed conditions as satisfied, but it
     will also summarize the number of suppressed conditions.


     In addition to suppressing a condition, you may "ignore" it.
     To  do  so,  you  use "I" or "i" just as you used "S" or "s"
     above:

     "test.c", line 3: [0: 1 0I] if was taken TRUE 1, FALSE 0 times.
     "test.c", line 3: [1: 0i] operator < might be <=.
     "test.c", line 3: [2: 1 i] condition 1 (argc, 1) was taken TRUE 1, FALSE 0 times.
     "test.c", line 3: [3: 0 I] condition 2 (argc, 1) was taken TRUE 0, FALSE 0 times.

     Unlike a suppressed condition, which is  treated  as  if  it
     were  satisfied,  an  ignored condition effectively does not
     exist.  Ignored conditions are not included in greport  out-
     put (even if the -_a_l_l option is used), and they play no part
     in gsummary totals.  Ignoring applies to an entire line: for
     an  if, ignoring either of the true or false conditions also
     ignores the other.

     In GCT 1.4, ignoring plays the role  that  deleting  mapfile
     entries  did  in earlier versions of GCT.  Never delete map-
     file entries in GCT 1.4.

          The _m_a_s_t_e_r _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is  the  directory  where  all  of

          This option changes the default name for the  map  file
          from "gct-map" to some other name.  Unless the argument
          is an absolute pathname, it is taken to be relative  to
          the master directory.

          useful.

ERRORS
     If gedit discovers an error in the input, it will quit, pos-
     sibly  leaving  the  mapfile partially edited. gedit makes a
     backup copy and leaves it in a file with the extension _g_b_k.

BUGS
     There is no way to unsuppress a condition, except  by  manu-
     ally  editing  the mapfile.  The _G_e_n_e_r_i_c _C_o_v_e_r_a_g_e _T_o_o_l (_G_C_T)

GCT-REMAP(1)             USER COMMANDS               GCT-REMAP(1)



NAME
     gct-remap -  Update  a  GCT  mapfile  when  a  file  is  re-
     instrumented

SYNOPSIS
     gct-remap [ -test-dir _m_a_s_t_e_r__d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y ] [ -test-map _m_a_p_f_i_l_e
     ] [ -forget ] [ -strict ]
         [ -update-copy ] [ -v ]

NOTE
     This program is only available with GCT Expansion Kit 1.

DESCRIPTION
     A normal  instrumentation  of  a  system  begins  with  gct-
     init(1),  continues  by using GCT on many C files, then fin-
     ishes by using GCT again to link all  the  resulting  object
     files  together.   When  one  of the files is changed, it is
     reinstrumented by calling GCT  on  it,  then  using  GCT  to
     relink the system.

     If GCT is not used to relink the system  (if,  for  example,
     the  -produce-object option is used), a normally hidden step
     - calling gct-remap - must be done manually before the  sys-
     tem is linked.  If this is not done, the mapfile will not be
     updated and will not correspond to the executable.   Neither
     greport  nor  gsummary will work correctly.  (They will fail
     in an obvious way.)

     In addition to incrementally updating the mapfile, gct_remap
     also  preserves  edits  made to the mapfile, both those made
     with gedit(1), called "line  edits",  and  the  other  kinds
     described in the _G_e_n_e_r_i_c _C_o_v_e_r_a_g_e _T_o_o_l (_G_C_T) _U_s_e_r'_s _G_u_i_d_e.

     If gct_remap made any changes, it leaves  backup  copies  of
     the  changed  files  in  _g_c_t-_m_a_p._g_b_k, _g_c_t-_p_s-_d_e_f_s._c~ _g_c_t-_p_s-
     _d_e_f_s._h~ (The inconsistent naming is to avoid filename length
     limits on older versions of UNIX.)

     gct_remap takes no arguments, other than options.

OPTIONS
     -test-dir _m_a_s_t_e_r__d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
          The _m_a_s_t_e_r _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is  the  directory  where  all  of
          gct's  data  files  are  kept.   By  default, it is the
          current directory.  This option  changes  the  default.
          Because  gct-remap also updates the files gct-ps-defs.c
          and gct-ps-defs.h, this option must be  given  whenever
          the  mapfile is not in the current directory.  That is,
          you must type

          % gct-remap -test-dir /tmp -test-map my-mapfile

     -test-map _m_a_p__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e
          This option changes the default name for the  map  file
          from "gct-map" to some other name.  Unless the argument
          is an absolute pathname, it is taken to be relative  to
          the master directory.  Note that gct-remap also updates
          the files gct-ps-defs.c and gct-ps-defs.h.  Their names
          cannot change.

     -strict
          Preserve line edits only on routines whose code is com-
          pletely  unchanged.   (Comments  and  white  space  can
          change.)  The default is to preserve them  on  routines
          with  the  same  instrumentation  in  the same order as
          before.  Other types of edits are always preserved.

     -forget
          Line edits are erased on all files,  whether  reinstru-
          mented  or  not.  It is as if gedit had never been run.
          Other types of edits are always preserved.

     -update-copy
          There may be more than one mapfile,  each  having  dif-
          ferent  edits.   Once  gct-remap  has  been  run on the
          first, this option should be used for the others.   The
          updated version is first concatenated to the end of the
          other copies, to tell gct-remap what has changed.  Here
          is an example.

               % make CC=gct             # Updates gct-map
               % cat gct-map >> other-mapfile
               % gct-remap -test-map other-mapfile -update-copy

          The already-updated mapfile should contain no edits; if
          it does, they will be merged into the updated copy.

          This option can also be used to update a completely new
          mapfile with the edits of an older mapfile:

               % gct-init
               % make CC=gct             # Create gct-map from scratch.
               % cat gct-map >> older-mapfile
               % gct-remap -test-map older-mapfile -update-copy
               % mv older-mapfile gct-map

          In both cases, the newer (current) mapfile should be at
          the _e_n_d of the concatenated mapfile given to gct-remap.

NAME
     gct-newlog - Update a GCT logfile to match new mapfile.

SYNOPSIS
     gct-newlog [ -test-dir _m_a_s_t_e_r__d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y ] [  -test-map  _n_e_w-
     _m_a_p_f_i_l_e ] [ -strict ] [ -v ] _o_l_d-_m_a_p_f_i_l_e _o_l_d-_l_o_g_f_i_l_e

NOTE
     This program is only available with GCT Expansion Kit 1.

DESCRIPTION
     This program takes an _o_l_d-_m_a_p_f_i_l_e,  an  _o_l_d-_l_o_g_f_i_l_e,  and  a
     _n_e_w-_m_a_p_f_i_l_e  and  produces a new logfile by updating the old
     one.  It is typically used to update a  logfile  after  some
     files in a program have been changed and reinstrumented.

     If a routine in the old mapfile is compatible with  the  new
     mapfile,  the  corresponding  counts  in the old logfile are
     carried over to the new logfile.  Otherwise, they are set to
     zero.   By  default,  a  routine is compatible if it has the
     same name, came from the same source file, and had the  same
     instrumentation added in the same order.  The new logfile is
     written to standard output.

     The following is a possible use of gct-newlog:

          % gct -o exec test.c test2.c
          % gct-newlog gct-map.gbk GCTLOG > GCTLOG.new

     This takes advantage of the fact that GCT's updating of  the
     mapfile at link time leaves a usable version of the old map-
     file in _g_c_t-_m_a_p._g_b_k. It is usually better to explicitly save
     a copy of the old mapfile before reinstrumenting code.

     gct-newlog does not require that one mapfile be a newer ver-
     sion  of the other.  It can be used to combine mapfiles from
     quite independent programs.  (This is useful only if the two
     programs share routines.)

OPTIONS
     -test-dir _m_a_s_t_e_r__d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
          The _m_a_s_t_e_r _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is  the  directory  where  all  of
          gct's  data  files  are  kept.   By  default, it is the
          current directory.  This option  changes  the  default.
          gct-remap also looks for the _o_l_d-_m_a_p_f_i_l_e in this direc-
          tory.

     -test-map _m_a_p__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e
          This option changes the default name for  the  new  map
          file  from  "gct-map"  to  some other name.  Unless the
          argument is an absolute pathname, it  is  taken  to  be
          relative to the master directory.

          sions of a routine are compatible only if their code is
          identical.  (Comments and white space can change.)

     -v   gct-newlog normally does not print messages about which
          routines  are incompatible.  This option turns on those
          messages.

BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES
     gct-newlog prints a message when all logfile entries  for  a
     routine are set to zero.  That message describes the routine
     as being inside a particular C file.   It  may  actually  be
     inside a file included by that C file.

GNEWER(1)                USER COMMANDS                  GNEWER(1)



NAME
     gnewer - produce difference of two gct log files.

SYNOPSIS
     gnewer [ -logical ] _o_l_d-_l_o_g _n_e_w-_l_o_g


DESCRIPTION
     gnewer is used to compare two log files.  The _n_e_w-_l_o_g  is  a
     cumulative  log,  containing  all the information of _o_l_d-_l_o_g
     plus information from later test runs.

     gnewer is most often used when  testing  programs  that  run
     cyclically.  For example, suppose you have a particular test
     for the UNIX kernel, and you want to see which conditions it
     forces.   The process of booting the kernel may satisfy some
     of those conditions.  Your  test  session  would  look  like
     this:

     1. Boot the kernel and extract a snapshot, _o_l_d-_l_o_g,  of  the
     conditions that were satisfied.
     2. Execute your test.
     3. Extract another snapshot, _n_e_w-_l_o_g.
     4. Run gnewer to see which conditions were satisfied by  the
     test  (plus  whatever  conditions  were satisfied during the
     extraction):

          % gnewer old-log new-log | greport
          % gnewer old-log new-log | gsummary


     For  each  coverage  condition,  the  arithmetic  difference
     between the new and old logfiles is printed to standard out-
     put.  This does not distinguish between two cases:

     1) The condition was satisfied 5 times in the old  log  file
     and 10 times in the new one.
     2) The condition was satisfied 0 times in the old  log  file
     and 5 times in the new one.

     In both cases, the resulting logfile will have  5  for  that
     coverage  condition.   To distinguish them, use the -_l_o_g_i_c_a_l
     option.  Case 1 will result in a 0 in  the  output  (meaning
     that either both or neither of the test suites satisfied the
     coverage condition).  Case 2 will result  in  a  1  (meaning
     that the new tests satisfy a previously unsatisfied coverage
     condition).

     In summary, gnewer piped into gsummary will  summarize  what
     the  new  tests do; gnewer -logical piped into gsummary will
     summarize what the new tests uniquely do.

GFILTER(1)               USER COMMANDS                 GFILTER(1)



NAME
     gfilter - filter GCT greport output.

SYNOPSIS
     gfilter [ -branch ] [ -loop ] [ -operator ] [ -operand  ]  [
     -multi ] [ -routine ] [ -call ] [ -race ] [ _r_e_p_o_r_t__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e
     ]

DESCRIPTION
     gfilter reads the output from greport(1).  It passes through
     only  report  lines  that correspond to flag arguments.  The
     flag arguments have the same names  as  those  used  in  the
     gct(1) control file.

     There is no -relational option; the -operator option applies
     to relational as well as all other kinds of operator lines.

     If no file name is given, standard input is used.

     Example:

     ernie-62% gfilter report.g
     ernie-63% gfilter -multi report.g
     "test.c", line 3: condition 1 (argc, 1) was taken TRUE 1, FALSE 0 times.
     "test.c", line 3: condition 2 (argc, 1) was taken TRUE 0, FALSE 0 times.
     ernie-64% gfilter -branch -multi report.g
     "test.c", line 3: if was taken TRUE 1, FALSE 0 times.
     "test.c", line 3: condition 1 (argc, 1) was taken TRUE 1, FALSE 0 times.
     "test.c", line 3: condition 2 (argc, 1) was taken TRUE 0, FALSE 0 times.
     "test.c", line 4: while was taken TRUE 1, FALSE 1 times.

SYNOPSIS
     gmerge _l_o_g__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e_1 [ _l_o_g__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e_2 ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     gmerge takes one or more  log  files  produced  by  programs
     instrumented  with gct(1).  It produces a summary logfile on
     its standard output.  The counts in the summary log file are
     the sum of the counts in the input log files.

     A maximum of 100 logfiles can be merged at a time.

     Example of usage:
          host-1% gmerge test3_log test4_log > all_log

SYNOPSIS
     gct-init [ -test-map _m_a_p_f_i_l_e-_n_a_m_e ]

DESCRIPTION
     gct-init copies initial versions of GCT utility  files  into
     the  current  directory.   By  default, it creates a mapfile
     named _g_c_t-_m_a_p. If the -test-map option is given,  its  argu-
     ment is used as the name.

NAME
     gclean - remove files created by GCT.

SYNOPSIS
     gclean

DESCRIPTION
     gclean removes all the files in the current  directory  that
     GCT created.  These files are:

     gct-ps-defs.h
     gct-map
     gct-map.gbk
     gct-rscript
     gct-rscript.bk
     gct_backup (and all its contents)
     gct-ps-defs.c
     gct-ps-defs.c~
     gct-ps-defs.h
     gct-ps-defs.h~
     gct-write.c
     gct-defs.h

     If you edited any of these files (when using race  coverage,
     for  example,  or by calling gedit), you may not want to use
     gclean.

BUGS
     gclean doesn't remove all the  gct_backup  directories  that
     might  have been created; only the one in the current direc-
     tory.

GRESTORE(1)              USER COMMANDS                GRESTORE(1)



NAME
     grestore - restore the original versions  of  files  instru-
     mented by gct.

SYNOPSIS
     grestore [ -test-dir _m_a_s_t_e_r__d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y ]

DESCRIPTION
     grestore is only relevant if (options  -produce-object)  was
     used  in the control file.  In this case, GCT moves the ori-
     ginal source  into  a  subdirectory  named  _g_c_t__b_a_c_k_u_p,  and
     instructions for copying it back are placed in a file called
     gct-rscript in the master directory.  grestore restores  the
     original source.

     If the source files are in several directories,  there  will
     be  the  same number of gct_backup directories, but only one
     gct-rscript.

     Example of use:
          host-1% grestore

     You may get a message that gct-rscript does not  exist  when
     you think it should.  The usual cause of this is as follows:

     1) You run GCT from within your  makefile.   GCT  fails  for
     some reason, such as a syntax error in a file.  The makefile
     halts because of the error, therefore grestore isn't run.

     2) You fix the problem and run make again.  GCT  immediately
     fails   because   you're   trying   to  instrument  already-
     instrumented files.

     3) You run grestore by hand.  Unfortunately, the first thing
     the  makefile  did  was  run  gct-init,  which  removes gct-
     rscript.

     Don't panic.  The previous  version  of  gct-rscript  is  in
     gct-rscript.bk.  All you need to do is type:

     % mv gct-rscript.bk gct-rscript
     % grestore

     Even if gct-rscript.bk is missing for some reason, the  ori-
     ginal  versions  of  the instrumented files are still in the
     gct_backup directories, and they can be copied to their ori-
     ginal locations manually.

     To avoid the problem, make sure you run grestore manually if
     the make exits abnormally.

GRESTORE(1)              USER COMMANDS                GRESTORE(1)



     grestore does not remove the copies  of  the  files  in  the
     gct_backup  directory.  This wastes space, but can be useful
     if the original copy is accidentally deleted.

OPTIONS
     -test-dir _m_a_s_t_e_r__d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
          If you specified a master directory when you used  gct,
          gct-rscript  is  in  that  directory.  You must use the
          -test-dir option to give grestore the same directory as
          you gave gct.

BUGS
     The restored file's attributes should be  identical  to  the
     original  file's,  save for an updated modification time (to
     force replacement of the instrumented object file  the  next
     time  the  program  is rebuilt).  GCT currently falls short.
     The read-write-execute bits of the mode will  be  the  same,
     but other mode bits are lost.  (It's rare for C source files
     to have the other bits set.)  The file will be owned by  the
     instrumenter, who may not have been the original owner.

GLIST(1)                 USER COMMANDS                   GLIST(1)



NAME
     glist - Create a code listing with GCT test coverage annota-
     tions.

SYNOPSIS
     glist [ -s _p_o_i_n_t-_s_i_z_e ] [ -l ] [ -t ] [  -r  ]  _r_e_p_o_r_t-_f_i_l_e-
     _n_a_m_e...

DESCRIPTION
     glist creates a listing of your source code, annotated  with
     messages  indicating  where  you  have not fully tested your
     code.  glist uses _r_e_p_o_r_t-_f_i_l_e-_n_a_m_e  or  stdin  to  determine
     where  to  place  annotations.  The output is PostScript(tm)
     suitable for printing on  any  PostScript  printer  or  pre-
     viewer.

     glist requires perl

OPTIONS
     -s _p_o_i_n_t-_s_i_z_e
          Specifies the point size to use printing lines of code.
          The default point size is 10 points.

     -l   Specifies to print line numbers in the right hand  mar-
          gin  every  five  lines.   By default glist only prints
          line numbers to the right of lines which  have  missing
          test coverage.

     -t   Specifies that glist should truncate lines which extend
          past  the right hand margin.  By default long lines are
          wrapped.

     -r   Specifies that the  listing  should  be  rotated  (i.e.
          printed  in a landscape orientation instead of portrait
          orientation).

GCC(1)                   USER COMMANDS                     GCC(1)



NAME
     gcc - GNU project C Compiler

SYNOPSIS
     gcc [ options ] files

WARNING
     This man page is an extract of the documentation of the  _G_N_U
     _C _c_o_m_p_i_l_e_r and is limited to the meaning of the options.  It
     is updated only occasionally, because the GNU  project  does
     not  use  nroff.  For complete, current documentation, refer
     to the Info file gcc or the DVI file gcc.dvi which are  made
     from the Texinfo source file gcc.texinfo.

DESCRIPTION
     The _G_N_U _C _c_o_m_p_i_l_e_r uses a command syntax much like the  Unix
     C  compiler.  The _g_c_c program accepts options and file names
     as operands.  Multiple  single-letter  options  may  _n_o_t  be
     grouped:  -dr is very different from -d -r.  When you invoke
     GNU CC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,  assem-
     bly  and linking.  File names which end in .c are taken as C
     source to be preprocessed and compiled; file names ending in
     .i are taken as preprocessor output to be compiled; compiler
     output files plus any input files with names  ending  in  .s
     are  assembled;  then  the  resulting object files, plus any
     other input files, are linked together to produce an execut-
     able.   Command options allow you to stop this process at an
     intermediate stage.  For example, the -c option says not  to
     run  the  linker.   Then the output consists of object files
     output by the assembler.  Other command options  are  passed
     on  to  one  stage  of processing.  Some options control the
     preprocessor and others  the  compiler  itself.   Yet  other
     options  control  the  assembler  and  linker; these are not
     documented here, but you rarely need to use any of them.

OPTIONS
     Here are the options to control the overall compilation pro-
     cess,  including  those that say whether to link, whether to
     assemble, and so on.

     -o _f_i_l_e
          Place output in file _f_i_l_e.  This applies regardless  to
          whatever  sort  of output is being produced, whether it
          be an executable file, an  object  file,  an  assembler
          file or preprocessed C code.

          If -o is not specified, the default is to put  an  exe-
          cutable  file  in  a.out,  the  object file _s_o_u_r_c_e.c in
          _s_o_u_r_c_e.o, an assembler file in  _s_o_u_r_c_e.s,  and  prepro-
          cessed C on standard output.

     -c   Compile or assemble the source files, but do not  link.

GCC(1)                   USER COMMANDS                     GCC(1)



          Produce object files with names made by replacing .c or
          .s with .o at the end of  the  input  file  names.   Do
          nothing at all for object files specified as input.

     -S   Compile into assembler code but do not  assemble.   The
          assembler output file name is made by replacing .c with
          .s at the end of the input file name.   Do  nothing  at
          all  for  assembler source files or object files speci-
          fied as input.

     -E   Run only the C  preprocessor.   Preprocess  all  the  C
          source  files specified and output the results to stan-
          dard output.

     -v   Compiler driver program prints the commands it executes
          as it runs the preprocessor, compiler proper, assembler
          and linker.  Some of these are directed to print  their
          own version numbers.

     -pipe
          Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication
          between  the various stages of compilation.  This fails
          to work on some systems where the assembler  is  unable
          to read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has no trou-
          ble.

     -B_p_r_e_f_i_x
          Compiler driver program tries _p_r_e_f_i_x as  a  prefix  for
          each  program it tries to run.  These programs are _c_p_p,
          _c_c_1, _a_s and _l_d.

          For each subprogram to  be  run,  the  compiler  driver
          first tries the -B prefix, if any.  If that name is not
          found, or if -B was not specified, the driver tries two
          standard   prefixes,   which   are   /usr/lib/gcc-  and
          /usr/local/lib/gcc-.  If neither of those results in  a
          file name that is found, the unmodified program name is
          searched for using the directories  specified  in  your
          PATH environment variable.

          The run-time support file gnulib is also  searched  for
          using  the  -B  prefix,  if needed.  If it is not found
          there, the two standard prefixes above are  tried,  and
          that is all.  The file is left out of the link if it is
          not found by those means.  Most of the  time,  on  most
          machines, you can do without it.

          You can get a similar result from the environment vari-
          able  GCC_EXEC_PREFIX;  if  it is defined, its value is
          used as a prefix in the  same  way.   If  both  the  -B
          option  and  the  GCC_EXEC_PREFIX variable are present,
          the  -B  option  is  used  first  and  the  environment

          variable value second.

     -b_p_r_e_f_i_x
          The argument _p_r_e_f_i_x is used as a second prefix for  the
          compiler  executables  and  libraries.   This prefix is
          optional: the compiler tries each file first  with  it,
          then without it.  This prefix follows the prefix speci-
          fied with -B or the default prefixes.

          Thus, -bvax- -Bcc/ in the presence of environment vari-
          able GCC_EXEC_PREFIX with definition /u/foo/ causes GNU
          CC to try the following file names for the preprocessor
          executable:

               cc/vax-cpp
               cc/cpp
               /u/foo/vax-cpp
               /u/foo/cpp
               /usr/local/lib/gcc-vax-cpp
               /usr/local/lib/gcc-cpp
               /usr/lib/gcc-vax-cpp
               /usr/lib/gcc-cpp These options control the details
          of C compilation itself.

     -ansi
          Support all ANSI standard C programs.

          This turns off certain  features  of  GNU  C  that  are
          incompatible  with  ANSI C, such as the asm, inline and
          typeof keywords, and predefined macros such as unix and
          vax that identify the type of system you are using.  It
          also enables the undesirable and rarely used ANSI  tri-
          graph feature.

          The  alternate   keywords   __asm__,   __inline__   and
          __typeof__  continue  to work despite -ansi.  You would
          not want to use them in an ANSI C program,  of  course,
          but it useful to put them in header files that might be
          included in compilations done  with  -ansi.   Alternate
          predefined macros such as __unix__ and __vax__ are also
          available, with or without -ansi.

          The -ansi option does not cause non-ANSI programs to be
          rejected gratuitously.  For that, -pedantic is required
          in addition to -ansi.

          The macro __STRICT_ANSI__ is predefined when the  -ansi
          option  is  used.   Some  header  files may notice this
          macro and refrain from declaring certain  functions  or
          defining  certain macros that the ANSI standard doesn't
          call for; this is to avoid interfering  with  any  pro-
          grams that might use these names for other things.

     -traditional
          Attempt to support some aspects of traditional  C  com-
          pilers.  Specifically:

        * All extern declarations take effect  globally  even  if
          they are written inside of a function definition.  This
          includes implicit declarations of functions.

        * The keywords typeof, inline, signed, const and volatile
          are not recognized.

        * Comparisons between pointers and  integers  are  always
          allowed.

        * Integer types unsigned short and unsigned char  promote
          to unsigned int.

        * Out-of-range floating point literals are not an error.

        * All  automatic  variables  not  declared  register  are
          preserved  by  _l_o_n_g_j_m_p(3C).   Ordinarily, GNU C follows
          ANSI C: automatic variables not declared  volatile  may
          be clobbered.

        * In the preprocessor, comments  convert  to  nothing  at
          all,  rather  than to a space.  This allows traditional
          token concatenation.

        * In the preprocessor,  macro  arguments  are  recognized
          within  string  constants  in  a  macro definition (and
          their values are stringified, though without additional
          quote  marks, when they appear in such a context).  The
          preprocessor always considers a string constant to  end
          at a newline.

        * The predefined macro __STDC__ is not defined  when  you
          use -traditional, but __GNUC__ is (since the GNU exten-
          sions which __GNUC__  indicates  are  not  affected  by
          -traditional).   If you need to write header files that
          work differently depending on whether  -traditional  is
          in  use, by testing both of these predefined macros you
          can distinguish four situations: GNU C, traditional GNU
          C, other ANSI C compilers, and other old C compilers.

     -O   Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes  somewhat  more
          time, and a lot more memory for a large function.

          Without -O, the compiler's goal is to reduce  the  cost
          of  compilation  and  to  make  debugging  produce  the
          expected results.  Statements are independent:  if  you
          stop  the program with a breakpoint between statements,
          you can then assign a new  value  to  any  variable  or



Version 1.36        Last change: 18 June 1989                   4






GCC(1)                   USER COMMANDS                     GCC(1)



          change  the  program  counter to any other statement in
          the function and get  exactly  the  results  you  would
          expect from the source code.

          Without -O, only variables declared register are  allo-
          cated  in  registers.  The resulting compiled code is a
          little worse than produced by PCC without -O.

          With -O, the compiler tries to  reduce  code  size  and
          execution time.

          Some of the -f options described  below  turn  specific
          kinds of optimization on or off.

     -g   Produce debugging information in the operating system's
          native format (for DBX or SDB).  GDB also can work with
          this debugging information.

          Unlike most other C compilers, GNU CC allows you to use
          -g  with -O.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may
          occasionally produce surprising results: some variables
          you  declared may not exist at all; flow of control may
          briefly move where you did not expect it;  some  state-
          ments may not be executed because they compute constant
          results or their values  were  already  at  hand;  some
          statements may execute in different places because they
          were moved out of loops.  Nevertheless it proves possi-
          ble  to  debug optimized output.  This makes it reason-
          able to use the optimizer for programs that might  have
          bugs.

     -gg  Produce debugging  information  in  GDB's  own  format.
          This  requires the GNU assembler and linker in order to
          work.

          This feature  will  probably  be  eliminated.   It  was
          intended to enable GDB to read the symbol table faster,
          but it doesn't result in enough  of  a  speedup  to  be
          worth  the larger object files and executables.  We are
          working on other ways of making GDB start even  faster,
          which  work  with  DBX format debugging information and
          could be made to work with SDB format.

     -w   Inhibit all warning messages.

     -W   Print extra warning messages for these events:

        * An automatic variable is used without first being  ini-
          tialized.

          These warnings are possible only in optimizing compila-
          tion,  because  they require data flow information that



Version 1.36        Last change: 18 June 1989                   5






GCC(1)                   USER COMMANDS                     GCC(1)



          is computed only when optimizing.  If you don't specify
          -O, you simply won't get these warnings.

          These warnings occur only for variables that are candi-
          dates  for register allocation.  Therefore, they do not
          occur for a variable  that  is  declared  volatile,  or
          whose  address is taken, or whose size is other than 1,
          2, 4 or 8 bytes.  Also, they do not  occur  for  struc-
          tures,  unions  or arrays, even when they are in regis-
          ters.

          Note that there may be no warning about a variable that
          is  used  only  to compute a value that itself is never
          used, because such computations may be deleted by  data
          flow analysis before the warnings are printed.

          These warnings are made optional because GNU CC is  not
          smart  enough to see all the reasons why the code might
          be correct despite appearing to have an error.  Here is
          one example of how this can happen:

               {
                 int x;
                 switch (y)
                   {
                   case 1: x = 1;
                     break;
                   case 2: x = 4;
                     break;
                   case 3: x = 5;
                   }
                 foo (x);
               }

          If the value of _y is always 1, 2 or 3, then _x is always
          initialized,  but  GNU  CC  doesn't know this.  Here is
          another common case:

               {
                 int save_y;
                 if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
                 ...
                 if (change_y) y = save_y;
               }

          This has no bug because _s_a_v_e__y is used only  if  it  is
          set.

          Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare as
          volatile all the functions you use that never return.

        * A nonvolatile automatic variable might be changed by  a



Version 1.36        Last change: 18 June 1989                   6

          call to _l_o_n_g_j_m_p(3C).  These warnings as well are possi-
          ble only in optimizing compilation.

          The compiler sees only the  calls  to  _s_e_t_j_m_p(3C).   It
          cannot  know where _l_o_n_g_j_m_p(3C) will be called; in fact,
          a signal handler could call it  at  any  point  in  the
          code.   As  a  result,  you may get a warning even when
          there is in fact no problem because _l_o_n_g_j_m_p(3C)  cannot
          in  fact  be  called  at  the place which would cause a
          problem.

        * A function can return either with or without  a  value.
          (Falling off the end of the function body is considered
          returning without a value.) For example, this  function
          would evoke such a warning:

               foo (a)
               {
                 if (a > 0)
                   return a;
               }

          Spurious warnings can occur because  GNU  CC  does  not
          realize that certain functions (including _a_b_o_r_t(3C) and
          _l_o_n_g_j_m_p(3C)) will never return.

        * An expression-statement contains no side effects.

          In the  future,  other  useful  warnings  may  also  be
          enabled by this option.

     -Wimplicit
          Warn whenever a function is implicitly declared.

     -Wreturn-type
          Warn whenever a function is defined with a  return-type
          that  defaults  to  int.   Also  warn  about any return
          statement with no  return-value  in  a  function  whose
          return-type is not void.

     -Wunused
          Warn whenever a local variable is unused aside from its
          declaration, and whenever a function is declared static
          but never defined.

     -Wswitch
          Warn whenever  a  switch  statement  has  an  index  of
          enumeral  type  and lacks a case for one or more of the
          named codes of that enumeration.  (The  presence  of  a
          default  label prevents this warning.) case labels out-
          side the enumeration range also provoke  warnings  when
          this option is used.

     -Wcomment
          Warn whenever a comment-start sequence /* appears in  a
          comment.

     -Wtrigraphs
          Warn if any trigraphs are  encountered  (assuming  they
          are enabled).

          All of the above -W options combined.   These  are  all
          the  options  which  pertain  to  usage  that we do not
          recommend and that we believe is always easy to  avoid,
          even in conjunction with macros.

          The other -W...  options below are not implied by -Wall
          because  certain  kinds  of  useful  macros  are almost
          impossible to write without causing those warnings.

     -Wshadow
          Warn whenever a local variable  shadows  another  local
          variable.

     -Wid-clash-_l_e_n
          Warn whenever two distinct  identifiers  match  in  the
          first _l_e_n characters.  This may help you prepare a pro-
          gram that will compile with  certain  obsolete,  brain-
          damaged compilers.

     -Wpointer-arith
          Warn about anything that depends on the size of a func-
          tion type or of void.  GNU C assigns these types a size
          of 1, for  convenience  in  calculations  with  void  *
          pointers and pointers to functions.

     -Wcast-qual
          Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a  type
          qualifier from the target type.  For example, warn if a
          const char * is cast to an ordinary char *.

     -Wwrite-strings
          Give string constants the type  const  char[_l_e_n_g_t_h]  so
          that copying the address of one into a non-const char *
          pointer will get a warning.  These warnings  will  help
          you  find  at  compile  time code that can try to write
          into a string constant, but only if you have been  very
          careful  about  using  const in declarations and proto-
          types.  Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance; this  is
          why we did not make -Wall request these warnings.

     -pg  Generate extra code to write profile information  suit-
          able for the analysis program _g_p_r_o_f(1).

     -a   Generate extra code to write  profile  information  for
          basic   blocks,   suitable  for  the  analysis  program
          _t_c_o_v(1).  Eventually GNU _g_p_r_o_f(1) should be extended to
          process this data.

     -l_l_i_b_r_a_r_y
          Search a standard list of  directories  for  a  library
          named   _l_i_b_r_a_r_y,   which   is  actually  a  file  named
          lib_l_i_b_r_a_r_y.a.  The linker uses this file as if  it  had
          been specified precisely by name.

          The directories searched include several standard  sys-
          tem directories plus any that you specify with -L.

          Normally the files found this way are  library  files--
          archive  files  whose  members  are  object files.  The
          linker handles an archive file by scanning  through  it
          for  members which define symbols that have so far been
          referenced but not defined.  But if the  file  that  is
          found  is  an ordinary object file, it is linked in the
          usual fashion.  The only difference between using an -l
          option  and  specifying a file name is that -l searches
          several directories.

     -L_d_i_r
          Add directory _d_i_r to the  list  of  directories  to  be
          searched for -l.

     -nostdlib
          Don't use the standard  system  libraries  and  startup
          files  when  linking.  Only the files you specify (plus
          gnulib) will be passed to the linker.

     -m_m_a_c_h_i_n_e_s_p_e_c
          Machine-dependent option specifying something about the
          type  of  target machine.  These options are defined by
          the macro TARGET_SWITCHES in the  machine  description.
          The  default  for  the  options is also defined by that
          macro, which enables you to change the defaults.

          These are the -m options defined in the  68000  machine
          description:

          -m68020
          -mc68020
               Generate output for a 68020 (rather than a 68000).
               This  is  the  default  if  you use the unmodified
               sources.

          -m68881
               Generate output containing 68881 instructions  for
               floating  point.   This  is the default if you use
               the unmodified sources.

          -mfpa
               Generate output containing  Sun  FPA  instructions
               for floating point.

          -mshort
               Consider type int to be 16 bits wide,  like  short
               int.

          -mnobitfield
               Do not use the  bit-field  instructions.   -m68000
               implies -mnobitfield.

          -mbitfield
               Do  use  the  bit-field   instructions.    -m68020
               implies  -mbitfield.   This  is the default if you
               use the unmodified sources.

          -mrtd
               Use a different  function-calling  convention,  in
               which  functions that take a fixed number of argu-
               ments return with the rtd instruction, which  pops
               their  arguments  while returning.  This saves one
               instruction in the caller since there is  no  need
               to pop the arguments there.

               This calling convention is incompatible  with  the
               one normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if
               you need to call libraries compiled with the  Unix
               compiler.

               Also, you must provide function prototypes for all
               functions  that take variable numbers of arguments
               (including printf(3S)); otherwise  incorrect  code
               will be generated for calls to those functions.

               In addition, seriously incorrect code will  result
               if  you  call  a function with too many arguments.
               (Normally,   extra   arguments   are    harmlessly
               ignored.)

          These -m switches are supported on the Sparc:

          -mfpu
               Generate output containing floating point instruc-
               tions.  This is the default if you use the unmodi-
               fied sources.

          -msoft-float
               Generate  output  containing  library  calls   for
               floating point.

          -mno-epilogue
               Generate separate return instructions  for  return
               statements.   This  has both advantages and disad-
               vantages; I don't recall what they are.

          These -m options are  defined  in  the  Convex  machine
          description:

          -mc1
               Generate output for a C1.   This  is  the  default
               when the compiler is configured for a C1.

          -mc2
               Generate output for a C2.   This  is  the  default
               when the compiler is configured for a C2.

          -margcount
               Generate code which puts an argument count in  the
               word  preceding each argument list.  Some nonport-
               able Convex  and  Vax  programs  need  this  word.

               table.)

          -mnoargcount
               Omit the argument count word.  This is the default
               if you use the unmodified sources.

     -f_f_l_a_g
          Specify machine-independent  flags.   Most  flags  have
          both  positive and negative forms; the negative form of
          -ffoo would be -fno-foo.  In the table below, only  one
          of  the  forms  is  listed--the  one  which  is not the
          default.  You can figure out the other form  by  either
          removing no- or adding it.

     -fpcc-struct-return
          Use the same convention for returning struct and  union
          values  that  is  used  by the usual C compiler on your
          system.  This convention is less  efficient  for  small
          structures,  and  on many machines it fails to be reen-
          trant; but it has the advantage of allowing intercalla-
          bility between GCC-compiled code and PCC-compiled code.

     -ffloat-store
          Do not store  floating-point  variables  in  registers.
          This  prevents undesirable excess precision on machines
          such as the 68000 where the floating registers (of  the
          68881) keep more precision than a double is supposed to
          have.

          For most programs, the excess precision does only good,
          but  a  few  programs rely on the precise definition of
          IEEE floating point.  Use -ffloat-store for  such  pro-
          grams.

     -fno-asm
          Do not recognize asm, inline or typeof  as  a  keyword.
          These  words  may then be used as identifiers.  You can
          use __asm__, __inline__ and __typeof__ instead.

     -fno-defer-pop
          Always pop the arguments to each function call as  soon
          as  that function returns.  Normally the compiler (when
          optimizing) lets arguments accumulate on the stack  for
          several function calls and pops them all at once.

     -fstrength-reduce
          Perform the optimizations of  loop  strength  reduction
          and elimination of iteration variables.

     -fcombine-regs
          Allow the combine pass to combine an  instruction  that
          copies  one register into another.  This might or might

          not produce better code when used in addition to -O.  I
          am  interested  in  hearing  about  the difference this
          makes.

     -fforce-mem
          Force memory  operands  to  be  copied  into  registers
          before  doing  arithmetic  on  them.   This may produce
          better code by making all memory  references  potential
          common subexpressions.  When they are not common subex-
          pressions, instruction combination should eliminate the
          separate  register-load.   I  am  interested in hearing
          about the difference this makes.

     -fforce-addr
          Force memory address constants to be copied into regis-
          ters before doing arithmetic on them.  This may produce
          better code just as -fforce-mem may.  I  am  interested
          in hearing about the difference this makes.

     -fomit-frame-pointer
          Don't keep the frame pointer in a  register  for  func-
          tions  that  don't  need one.  This avoids the instruc-
          tions to save, set up and restore  frame  pointers;  it
          also  makes  an  extra register available in many func-
          tions.  It also makes debugging impossible.

          On some machines, such as the Vax,  this  flag  has  no
          effect, because the standard calling sequence automati-
          cally handles the frame pointer and nothing is saved by
          pretending  it  doesn't exist.  The machine-description
          macro FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED controls whether a  target
          machine supports this flag.

     -finline-functions
          Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The
          compiler heuristically decides which functions are sim-
          ple enough to be worth integrating in this way.

          If all calls to a given function  are  integrated,  and
          the  function  is declared static, then the function is
          normally not output as assembler code in its own right.

     -fcaller-saves
          Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be
          clobbered by function calls, by emitting extra instruc-
          tions to save and restore  the  registers  around  such
          calls.   Such  allocation is done only when it seems to
          result in better code than would otherwise be produced.

          This option is enabled by default on certain  machines,
          usually those which have no call-preserved registers to
          use instead.

     -fkeep-inline-functions
          Even if all calls to a given function  are  integrated,
          and  the function is declared static, nevertheless out-
          put a separate run-time callable version of  the  func-
          tion.

     -fwritable-strings
          Store string constants in the writable data segment and
          don't  uniquize  them.   This is for compatibility with
          old programs which assume they can  write  into  string
          constants.  Writing into string constants is a very bad
          idea; constants should be constant.

     -fcond-mismatch
          Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types  in
          the  second  and third arguments.  The value of such an
          expression is void.

     -fno-function-cse
          Do not put function addresses in registers;  make  each
          instruction  that calls a constant function contain the
          function's address explicitly.

          This option results in less efficient  code,  but  some
          strange  hacks  that  alter the assembler output may be
          confused  by  the  optimizations  performed  when  this
          option is not used.

     -fvolatile
          Consider all memory references through pointers  to  be
          volatile.

     -fshared-data
          Requests that the data and non-const variables of  this
          compilation  be  shared  data rather than private data.
          The distinction makes sense only on  certain  operating
          systems,  where shared data is shared between processes
          running the same program, while private data exists  in
          one copy per process.

     -funsigned-char
          Let the type char be the unsigned, like unsigned char.

          Each kind of machine has a default for what char should
          be.  It is either like unsigned char by default or like
          signed char by default.   (Actually,  at  present,  the
          default is always signed.)

          The type char is always a  distinct  type  from  either
          signed  char or unsigned char, even though its behavior
          is always just like one of those two.

          Note that this is equivalent to -fno-signed-char, which
          is the negative form of -fsigned-char.

     -fsigned-char
          Let the type char be signed, like signed char.

          Note that this  is  equivalent  to  -fno-unsigned-char,
          which is the negative form of -funsigned-char.

     -fdelayed-branch
          If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
          instructions  to  exploit  instruction  slots available
          after delayed branch instructions.

     -ffixed-_r_e_g
          Treat the register named _r_e_g as a fixed register;  gen-
          erated code should never refer to it (except perhaps as
          a stack pointer, frame pointer or in some  other  fixed
          role).

          _r_e_g must be the name of a register.  The register names
          accepted  are  machine-specific  and are defined in the
          REGISTER_NAMES macro in the machine  description  macro
          file.

          This flag does not have a  negative  form,  because  it
          specifies a three-way choice.

     -fcall-used-_r_e_g
          Treat the register named _r_e_g as an allocatable register
          that  is  clobbered by function calls.  It may be allo-
          cated for temporaries or variables  that  do  not  live
          across  a  call.   Functions compiled this way will not
          save and restore the register REG.

          Use of this flag for a register that has a  fixed  per-
          vasive  role  in the machine's execution model, such as
          the stack pointer or frame pointer, will produce disas-
          trous results.

          This flag does not have a  negative  form,  because  it
          specifies a three-way choice.

     -fcall-saved-_r_e_g
          Treat the register named _r_e_g as an allocatable register
          saved  by functions.  It may be allocated even for tem-
          poraries or variables that live across a  call.   Func-
          tions  compiled  this  way  will  save  and restore the
          register _r_e_g if they use it.

          trous results.

          A different sort of disaster will result from  the  use
          of  this  flag  for a register in which function values
          may be returned.

     -d_l_e_t_t_e_r_s
          Says to make debugging  dumps  at  times  specified  by
          _l_e_t_t_e_r_s.  Here are the possible letters:

          r
               Dump after RTL generation.
          j
               Dump after first jump optimization.
          J
               Dump after last jump optimization.
          s
               Dump after CSE (including  the  jump  optimization
               that sometimes follows CSE).
          L
               Dump after loop optimization.
          f
               Dump after flow analysis.
          c
               Dump after instruction combination.
          l

          g
               Dump after global register allocation.

               the run.

     -pedantic
          Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ANSI standard
          C; reject all programs that use forbidden extensions.

          Valid ANSI standard C programs should compile  properly
          with  or  without  this  option (though a rare few will
          require -ansi).  However, without this option,  certain
          GNU extensions and traditional C features are supported
          as well.  With this option, they are  rejected.   There
          is  no  reason  to  use  this option; it exists only to
          satisfy pedants.

          the  alternate  keywords whose names begin and end with
          __.

     -static
          On Suns running version 4, this prevents  linking  with
          the  shared libraries.  (-g has the same effect.) These
          options control the C preprocessor,  which  is  run  on
          each  C  source file before actual compilation.  If you
          use the `-E' option, nothing is done except  C  prepro-
          cessing.    Some  of  these  options  make  sense  only
          together with `-E' because  they  request  preprocessor
          output that is not suitable for actual compilation.

     -C   Tell the preprocessor not to  discard  comments.   Used
          with the -E option.

     -I_d_i_r
          Search directory _d_i_r for include files.

     -I-  Any directories specified with -I  options  before  the
          -I-  option  are searched only for the case of #include
          "_f_i_l_e"; they are not searched for #include <_f_i_l_e>.

          If additional directories are specified with -I options
          after  the  -I-, these directories are searched for all
          #include directives.  (Ordinarily  _a_l_l  -I  directories
          are used this way.)

          In addition, the -I- option inhibits  the  use  of  the
          current  directory  as  the  first search directory for
          #include "_f_i_l_e".  Therefore, the current  directory  is
          searched  only  if it is requested explicitly with -I..
          Specifying both -I- and -I. allows you to control  pre-
          cisely   which  directories  are  searched  before  the
          current one and which are searched after.

     -nostdinc
          Do not  search  the  standard  system  directories  for
          header  files.  Only the directories you have specified
          with  -I  options  (and  the  current   directory,   if
          appropriate) are searched.

          Between -nostdinc and -I-, you can eliminate all direc-
          tories from the search path except those you specify.

     -M   Tell the preprocessor to output  a  rule  suitable  for
          make(_1)  describing  the  dependencies  of  each source
          file.  For each source file, the  preprocessor  outputs
          one  make-rule whose target is the object file name for
          that source file and whose  dependencies  are  all  the
          files  #included in it.  This rule may be a single line
          or may be continued with \-newline if it is long.

          files included with #include <_f_i_l_e> are omitted.

          Support ANSI C trigraphs.  You don't want to know about
          this  brain-damage.   The  -ansi  option  also has this
