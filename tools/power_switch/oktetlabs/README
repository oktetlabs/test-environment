File application/power_sw_app.c - source for application to control power
switch device from tester host. Oktetlabs LPT and COM/USB power switch
devices are supported.

Files in firmware/ directory - source files for oktetlabs power switch firmware.
COM/USB power switch devices need controllers to interprete and execute
commands sent via serial port. AVR controllers are supported now. Specific
commands set are designed together with power switch controllers.

File firmware/power_sw_descr - description of commands set to control
COM/USB power switch devices

Files firmware/power_sw_tn2313.asm and tn2313def.inc - assembler code for
AVR attiny2313 controller.

File firmware/power_sw_mega8.asm - assembler code for AVR Atmega8 controller.

File firmware/sketch_powerswitch.ino - C++ power switch code for Arduino
nano platform (AVR atmega328 controller). Intended for compilation and binary
loading by means of Arduino IDE tool.
