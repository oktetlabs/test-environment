## Log streaming user tools #
#############################

This directory provides several scripts that can be useful for debugging
and testing TE's log streaming functionality:

1. listener_server.pl - provides a "reference" implementation of a log listener
2. log_replay.pl - emulates the requests that TE sends to log listeners

This document describes these scripts and their usage.

1. listener_server.pl
=====================

This script implements a basic log listener with the following capabilities:

* Receive HTTP requests that carry information about test execution
* Provide a minimal user interface to track test execution results and artifacts
* Allow the user to stop the current test run
* Record the log streaming session in a file (called 'weblog') in a format that
  can be used by log_replay.pl

In order to use this script with TE, the user has to do the following:

1. Prepare a configuration file for Logger

Listener configuration is performed in the "listeners" section. The following
example should suffice in most cases:

```
---
listeners:
    - name: listener_test
      url: http://localhost:3000/
      enabled: yes
      interval: 10
      buffer_size: 65536
      buffers_num: 4
      allow_stop: no
      rules:
        - filter:
            - exclude: 1
            - include: 1
              entity: Tester
              user: Control
          rule: test_progress
        - filter:
            - exclude: 1
            - include: 1
              level: MI
              user: Artifact
          rule: artifact
```

2. Start the server

This script uses the Mojolicious framework and the JSON package, so the user
needs to make sure they have it installed. On Debian-based systems, this can be
done with this command:

sudo apt-get install libmojolicious-perl libjson-perl

Once Mojolicious is installed, the user can start the server like this:

./listener_server.pl daemon

3. Start TE

In order to enable log streaming in TE, an additional command-line argument must
be specified:

* --logger-listener=<NAME> - enables a listener, a listener with the given name
                             is expected to be described in the config file

With the configuration file shown above, the full command to run the selftest
test suite looks like this:

./run.sh --cfg=gimli1 --logger-listener=listener_test --tester-req=\!BROKEN

2. log_replay.pl
================

This script takes a file with a log streaming session and replays the requests
to a given listener.

It relies on LWP and JSON perl packages. On Debian-based systems, they can be
installed like this:

sudo apt-get install libwww-perl libjson-perl

Once the user has installed the dependencies and prepared a recording of a log
streaming session, they can start the script like this:

./log_replay.pl http://localhost:3000 weblog

The following flags can be specified before the listener URL:

* --trailing-slash will make the script append trailing slashes to the URLs it
  uses to communicate with the listener (required for Bublik and other projects
  that use Django).

* --update-timestamps can be specified to make this script pretend that testing
  started now, i.e. the "init" event's timestamp will be set to current time
  and other timestamps will be adjusted to keep the same test duration. This is
  particularly useful with Bublik, where different runs usually require
  different timestamps.

* --start-timestamp=UNIXTIME is analogous to --update-timestamps, but allows
  the user to manually set the initial timestamp for the run. UNIXTIME is
  expected to be a UNIX timestamp.

Keep in mind that, at least in the current version of the script, the delays
between requests are not emulated. In other words, once a response is received,
the next request will be sent immediately.
