    PPPoE server on Agents.

    To resolve conflicts between PPPoE servers spawned by different test
    agents, each PPPoE server should be related to specific interface
    resource. But to reduce the amount of pppoe-server processes, it is
    allowed to configure PPPoE server to work with several vlan interfaces
    over the specified master interface.
