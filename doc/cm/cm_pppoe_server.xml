    <!--
        This configuration model is intended for describing of configuration
        related to pppoe server on Agents

        To resolve conflicts between pppoe servers spawned by different test
        agents, each pppoe server should be related to specific interface
        resource. But to reduce the amount of pppoe-server processes, it is
        allowed to configure pppoe server to work with several vlan interfaces
        over the specified master interface.
