    Network topology.

    Division into "networks" is pure logical and depends on testing purposes.
    E.g. if IP router is tested, all nodes connected to router port via
    Ethernet hub should be considered as elements of the same network.

      type: address
      d: |
         IPv4 subnet assigned to the network.

                For nodes of Agent type the value is in the following format:

                E.g.: /agent:A/interface:eth0

                For nodes of type bridge the value is in the following format:
                /agent:<agent name>/port:<port id>
                E.g.: /agent:bridge/port:20
                Note that nodes of type bridge are identified as nodes of
                type nut.
