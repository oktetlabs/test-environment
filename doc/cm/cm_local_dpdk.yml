      type: none
      d: |
        DPDK has a mechanism which poll mode drivers can use to advertise
        supported offloads. However, it is not always possible to express
        all limitations, and there is no means to indicate fixed offloads.
        So, tests need to exercise a knowledge base to know which devices
        support which offloads, and which offloads happen to be immutable.
