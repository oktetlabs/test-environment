    - oid: "/local/socklib"
      access: read_write
      type: string

    - oid: "/local/env"
      access: read_create
      type: string
      d: |
        Environment variables to be set on corresponding test agents upon request
        (see tapi_cfg_env_local_to_agent() in lib/tapi). Typically it is done
        from prologue. It allows to forward test engine side environment variables
        value to test agents.

      type: string
      d: |
        RPC servers to be created on corresponding test agents upon request
        (see tapi_cfg_rpcs_local_to_agent() in lib/tapi). Typically it is done
        from prologues.
          Name: RPC server name

      type: integer
      d: |
         Ignore errors returned when RPC server is destroyed and try to
         continue restart process. Delete operation may return non-zero
         value if ta_waitpid() returns non-zero status code, e.g. if the
         process is killed or segfaults. In fact the option is dedicated to
         tune behavior of function rcf_rpc_server_restart().

         Name: none

        on IUT RPC server as an error.
          Name: none
          Value: 0 = errno change is an error,
                 not 0 = errno change is not an error
