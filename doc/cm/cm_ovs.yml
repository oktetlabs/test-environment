      d: |
         Open vSwitch interface registry.

         @note  Adding a new instance to the registry and changing the interface
                settings will only affect the internal context of this interface
                in Configurator. The context will be used to construct ovs-vsctl
                commands if the user adds a port referencing this interface to a
                port registry. Once that port grabs the interface, the user will
                not be able to reconfigure or remove the latter until the former
                gets removed. Please check the notes for the port registry below.

         @note  Once the user adds a bridge to the bridge registry, an immutable
                instance will show up in the interface registry to represent the
                bridge local interface. The instance name will match that of the
                bridge, and none of the settings will be amenable to adjustments.

         @todo  Add support for "tap", "geneve", "gre" and "vxlan" interface types
         @todo  Add DPDK-specific interface status indicators (resource limits)
         @todo  Add interface statistics subtree

         Name:  interface name

      access: read_write
      type: string
      d: |
         Open vSwitch interface MAC address.

         @note  An instance value is an empty string upon interface creation and
                may be adjusted. Once a port grabs the interface, the value will
                be updated to report the effective setting used by the interface.

         Name:  none
         Value: "", "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"

         Open vSwitch interface OpenFlow port number.

         @note  An instance value is indicated as 0 after interface creation and
                may be adjusted. Once a port grabs the interface, the value will
                be updated to report the effective setting used by the interface.

         Name:  none

         Open vSwitch interface MTU.

         @note  An instance value is indicated as 0 after interface creation and
                may be adjusted. Once a port grabs the interface, the value will
                be updated to report the effective setting used by the interface.

         Name:  none
         Value: 0, 68 .. 65535

         Tunnel options.
         Applicable only to tunnel interface types ("vxlan", "geneve", "gre").
         remote_ip - remote tunnel endpoint;
         local_ip - the tunnel destination IP that received  packets  must match;
         in_key - the key that received packets must contain;
         out_key - the key to be set on outgoing packets;

         Name: one of tunnel options
         Value: value of corresponding to option format

      depends:
        - oid: "/agent/ovs/status"
      d: |
         Open vSwitch bridge registry.

         @note  An instance value stands for the bridge datapath type.

         @todo  Add bridge MAC learning settings

         Name:  bridge name
         Value: "system", "netdev"

    - oid: "/agent/ovs/bridge/port"
      access: read_create
      type: string
      d: |
         Open vSwitch bridge port registry.

         @note  A port may comprise either a single interface or a group of them.
                The interface(s) which need some custom settings must be present
                in the interface registry with all the applicable properties set.
                If the property values are incorrect, the port will not be added.
                If an interface referenced by the port does not have an instance
                in the interface registry, default settings will be assumed, and
                the said instance will be added to the said registry temporarily.
                Removing the port will make such an interface instance disappear.

         @note  A regular port name must match that of the port's interface, and
                a bonded port name must not match that of any possible interface.

         @note  An instance value of a regular port must be an empty string, and
                that of a bonded port has to be a space-separated interface list.
                At least two interface names must be specified for a bonded port.

         @todo  Introduce /agent/ovs/bridge/port/bond subtree with bond settings.
                Provide support for "balance-slb" and "active-backup" bond types.

         Name:  (bonded) port name
         Value: "", space separated list of interface names

      access: read_write
      type: string
      d: |
         Open vSwitch bridge port VLAN mode and settings subtree.

         @note  If the value is an empty string, then the port is either
                an access port or a trunk port depending on whether
                below "tag" value equals -1 or not.
                See [1] -> "Port TABLE" -> "Details" -> "VLAN Configuration".

                Empty value defaults to 0x88a8.
