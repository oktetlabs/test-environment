    Processes control configuration model.

    It is assumed to care about processes spawned from the Test Agent via
    the configuration tree. Other processes are not tracked/represented.

- register:

    - oid: "/agent/process"
      access: read_create
      type: none
      d: |
        Process instance.
        Name: internal process name

    - oid: "/agent/process/exe"
      access: read_write
      type: string
      substitution: true
      d: |
        Executable to run with search in PATH if there is no path separators.

    - oid: "/agent/process/status"
      access: read_write
      type: integer
      d: |
        Either 1 (start/running) or 0 (stop/stopped/crashed) for
        non-autorestart processes.
        For processes with non-zero autorestart value 1 means start or
        that the process should be restarted when it stopped running;
        0 means stop, restart failure, or that the process should not be
        restarted.
        If the status is 0, it is not allowed to reconfigure the process.

    - oid: "/agent/process/autorestart"
      access: read_write
      type: integer
      d: |
        Time period in seconds to check if the process stopped working and
        restart it if this is the case. 0 means that the process should not be
        restarted.

    - oid: "/agent/process/long_option_value_separator"
      access: read_write
      type: string
      d: |
        Separator to be used between long option and its value.
        Supported values are empty (default) and '='.
        If value is empty, long option and its value are passed as different
        arguments. If value is '=', long option and its value are passed as
        --<long>=<value>.

    - oid: "/agent/process/option"
      access: read_create
      type: string
      d: |
        Process options to be passed as -<short> <value> or --<long> <value>.
        If value is empty string, it is assumed that the option has no value and
        should be passed without it, i.e. --<long>.
        Note: above makes it imposisble to have an option with really empty string
              value, but such options could be passed using /agent/process/arg.
        Name: option name (short if one letter, long otherwise)

    - oid: "/agent/process/arg"
      access: read_create
      type: string
      substitution: true
      d: |
        Process raw arguments to be added in specified order after options.
        Name: order

    - oid: "/agent/process/env"
      access: read_create
      type: string
      d: |
        Additional process environment variables.
        Name: environment variable name

    - oid: "/agent/process/kill"
      access: read_only
      type: none
      d: |
        Root node for nodes that allow sending signals to the process.

    - oid: "/agent/process/kill/self"
      access: read_write
      type: string
      volatile: true
      d: |
        Name of a signal that will be sent to the process immediately.

    - oid: "/agent/process/kill/group"
      access: read_write
      type: string
      volatile: true
      d: |
        Name of a signal that will be sent to the process group immediately.
