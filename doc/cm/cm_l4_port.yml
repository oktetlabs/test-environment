      type: none
      d: |
         Root of l4 port configuration model

         Name: None

    - oid: "/agent/l4_port/alloc"
      access: read_only

         Allocation of l4 ports on a test agent.

         Name: None

    - oid: "/agent/l4_port/alloc/next"
      access: read_only
      type: integer
      volatile: true
      d: |
         The next available port. A new port is allocated when the
         previous one is added to "/agent/l4_port/alloc/allocated",
         otherwise returns the last allocated port.

         Name: None
         Value: Value of the allocated port in host endian

    - oid: "/agent/l4_port/alloc/next/family"
      access: read_write
      type: integer
      d: |
         Socket family of the next allocated port. Setting this field might
         change "/agent/l4_port/alloc/next".

         Name: None
         Value: AF_INET (IPv4), AF_INET6 (IPv6), 0 (IPv6 with fallback to IPv4)

    - oid: "/agent/l4_port/alloc/next/type"
      access: read_write
      type: integer
      d: |
         Socket type of the next allocated port. Setting this field might
         change "/agent/l4_port/alloc/next".

         Name: None
         Value: SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM, 0 (for both TCP and UDP)

    - oid: "/agent/l4_port/alloc/allocated"
      access: read_create
      type: none
      d: |
         A collection of allocated ports
