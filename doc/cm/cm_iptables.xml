    <!--
        This configuration model is intended for describing of configuration
        related to iptables rules on Agents

        To avoid system-wide iptables rules usage, per-interface chains
        are created. Network interfaces are not shared between test agents
        and iptables rules for different interfaces should not interact
        with each other.
