    All other nodes's names are just sequential numbers (this allows to
    preserve order, which may be important)

    <!-- This is a mapping of RADIUS users file. 
    The node 'user' has a sequential number as its name and the user name as a value.
    'check' is a collection of all check items (named with sequential numbers) and
    'set' is a collection of actions.
    Both 'check' and 'set' are decomposed into attribute name, operator and value.

    That is (examples from users man page:
       bob  User-Password == "hello"

        DEFAULT   Auth-Type = System
                 Fall-Through = Yes

        DEFAULT Service-Type == Framed-User, Framed-Protocol == PPP
                Service-Type = Framed-User,
                Framed-Protocol = PPP,
                Fall-Through = Yes
