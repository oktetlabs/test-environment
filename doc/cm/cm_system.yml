      d: |
         Computing node (e.g. NUMA node).
         On small-scale systems there will be a single node.
         The available CPU info is organized into a tree (node >
         physical package > core > logical cpu), rather than a linear list
         of logical CPU so that it be possible to use node/package/core OIDs
         for resource grabbing.

         The tree is always visible because the current implementation
         consists only of read-only nodes and the tests should have
         the ability to choose a CPU with needed properties before grabbing.
         If any read-write nodes are implemented in the future, the subtrees
         with that nodes should be made invisible until the parent tree is
         grabbed as a resource.

         Currently all nodes are assumed to have the same architecture,
         but true heterogenous systems may eventually be supported.
         The arch value must be from a controlled vocabulary, not raw
         uname -m string.

         The following set of arch values is defined:
           - i386
           - x86_64
           - powerpc
           - powerpc64
           - powerpc64le

         Value: arch identifier

         Those are strings found in /proc/cpuinfo on Linux.
         On x86(_64) some of these values are integers, but since it
         cannot be warranted on all possible platforms, all values are
         declared as strings.

         FPU is present.
         On embedded architectures, this is a crucial feature, so it

         A set of CPU features.
         Since such a set is open and is platform-dependent, it's
         unreasonable to have a named boolean node for each feature.
         Instead, we have an empty node indexed by a feature designator as
         reported by /proc/cpuinfo Test libraries may (and should) provide
         wrapper function to check for more high-level and platform-specific
         conditions (e.g. the largest set of vectorized ops available etc)

         @todo Performance data, in particular NUMA non-local allocations
         @todo It would be helpful to detect physical parameters of memory
               chips, like the number of channels or clock speed. However,
               the required information is scattered between ACPI, DMI and
               EDAC and any arbitrary piece of it may be missing, so
               a reliable detection method, covering a wide range of
               platforms, is not, perhaps, worth the effort.

         NUMA memory access distance. In NUMA systems for every two nodes
         there is a metric showing how expensive is the access to memory
         at one node from a CPU at another node.  The absolute values are
         not meaningful and should be compared to the cost of local access.
         So, /agent:XXX/hardware/node:0/distance:1 would contain the
         distance from node 0 to node 1, wherea
         /agent:XXX/hardware/node:0/distance:0 would contain the cost value
         of local access.

    - oid: "/agent/hardware/sensor"

      d: |
         The conceptual problem with sensors, as well as with performance
         counters: the set of available counters/sensors varies greatly
         across systems, and the raw data are often meaningless, requiring
         some sort of calibration.
         So there are two ways:
           - provide low-level access to everything the system may provide
             and let the test or some other entity interpret the data,
           - identify some set of important parameters and make a bona fide
             effort to provide platform-independent way to access them.
