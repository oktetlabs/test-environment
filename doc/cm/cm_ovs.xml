    <!-- Open vSwitch interface registry.

         @note  Adding a new instance to the registry and changing the interface
                settings will only affect the internal context of this interface
                in Configurator. The context will be used to construct ovs-vsctl
                commands if the user adds a port referencing this interface to a
                port registry. Once that port grabs the interface, the user will
                not be able to reconfigure or remove the latter until the former
                gets removed. Please check the notes for the port registry below.

         @note  Once the user adds a bridge to the bridge registry, an immutable
                instance will show up in the interface registry to represent the
                bridge local interface. The instance name will match that of the
                bridge, and none of the settings will be amenable to adjustments.

         @todo  Add support for "dpdk", "tap", "geneve", "gre" and "vxlan" interface types
         @todo  Add DPDK-specific interface status indicators (resource limits)
         @todo  Add interface statistics subtree

    <!-- Open vSwitch interface MAC address.

         @note  An instance value is an empty string upon interface creation and

                be updated to report the effective setting used by the interface.

                be updated to report the effective setting used by the interface.

    <!-- Open vSwitch bridge port registry.

         @note  A port may comprise either a single interface or a group of them.
                The interface(s) which need some custom settings must be present
                in the interface registry with all the applicable properties set.
                If the property values are incorrect, the port will not be added.
                If an interface referenced by the port does not have an instance
                in the interface registry, default settings will be assumed, and
                the said instance will be added to the said registry temporarily.
                Removing the port will make such an interface instance disappear.

         @note  A regular port name must match that of the port's interface, and
                a bonded port name must not match that of any possible interface.

         @note  An instance value of a regular port must be an empty string, and
                that of a bonded port has to be a space-separated interface list.
                At least two interface names must be specified for a bonded port.

         @todo  Introduce /agent/ovs/bridge/port/bond subtree with bond settings.
                Provide support for "balance-slb" and "active-backup" bond types.
