- register:

    - oid: "/agent/key"
      access: read_create
      type: string
      d: |
        Agent-managed security keys.
        A new key is generated when an instance is created,
        and regenerated if key parameters have changed.

        Name: arbitrary label
        Value: key manager type (currently only 'ssh')

    - oid: "/agent/key/type"
      access: read_write
      type: string
      d: |
        The type of a key (key manager specific).
        For 'ssh', the value will be passed to
        'ssh-keygen -t'

    - oid: "/agent/key/bitsize"
      access: read_write
      type: integer
      d: |
        The length of the key in bits

    - oid: "/agent/key/private_file"
      access: read_only
      type: string
      d: |
        The name of the file at the agent side,
        holding the private part of the key (if exists).
        The name is guaranteed to be stable when a key is
        re-generated

    - oid: "/agent/key/public"
      access: read_only
      type: string
      volatile: true
      d: |
        The string representation of a public key
        (it is _not_ a name of a file). The format of the
        string is manager-specific
