        Root of memory configuration model.

        Name: none

    access: read_write
    type: integer
    depends:
        - oid: "/agent/rsrc"

       Alloc the specified number of hugepages. This object is a resource.
       It must be grabbed before it may be used.

       On Linux the value will be written to
       '/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepage-<size>kB'/nr_hugepages'.

       Linux will allocate as many pages as it has. Therefore, after setting
       a new value, a check is made that the requested number of pages is
       allocated.  If it is not, the old value will be written to this file
       and error ENOSPC will be returned to the user.

       Name: Hugepage size in kB
       Value: Number of the hugepages

  - oid: "/agent/mem/hugepages/mountpoint"
    access: read_create
    type: none
    depends:
        - oid: "/agent/rsrc"

      Mount the directory as a hugetlbfs filesystem with the
      appropriate 'pagesize' option.

      This object is a resource. It must be grabbed before it may be used.
      The path to the directory should be separated by '$', instead of a '/'
      to avoid configuration model confusing. If the directory already exists,
      it will not be created. Also if the directory is already mounted as
      hugetlbfs then it will not be mounted. These two cases are normal.

      Name: Directory name
      Value: none
