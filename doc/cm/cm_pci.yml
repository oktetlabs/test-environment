         The root of all PCI related information.

         @note This subtree is not intended for low-level operations with
         PCI devices, the configurator is not deterministic enough for it
         to be safe. So most of the underlying nodes are read-only, even
         if PCI technically allows read-write access.  The only exceptions
         are driver binding (/agent/hardware/pci/device/driver) and
         VF management (/agent/hardware/pci/device/sriov/vf).

      d: |
         The list of PCI vendor IDs for installed devices.
         We do not want the agent exposes the whole PCI tree to tests
         because it's an unnecessary overhead for agents and configurator:
         On a modern system, there are tons of PCI devices, most of which are
         system support devices which should not be ever useful for testing
         purposes; and trying to obtain information from all these devices
         takes a lot of time.

         The second consideration is that we want to reserve PCI devices
         using the configurator /agent/rsrc. It is not convenient to specify
         direct PCI address, because it makes configuration too fragile.
         It would be preferrable to specify just "the first function of a
         certain NIC" etc.

         On the other hand, using vendor+device+ordinal as a sole identifier
         for PCI devices is also not convenient, because in several places we
         have a system-provided PCI address, and to map it to
         vendor+device+ordinal requires scanning the whole PCI tree.

         So the procedure is as follows: if a test is interested in some
         devices, it makes a resource with
         /agent/hardware/pci/vendor:VENDOR/device:DEVICE/instance:NTH as value.
         The agent then will do PCI scanning and:
         - create /agent/hardware/pci/vendor:VENDOR/device:DEVICE/instance:NTH
           having the real OID of the PCI device
         - create /agent/hardware/pci/device:ADDRESS node corresponding to
           the real device

         All levels of the hierarchy may be used for locking. That is,
         assigning /agent/hardware/pci to /agent/rsrc would lock the whole
         PCI tree (which is only possible if nobody else is helding any PCI
         device locks), and the whole PCI tree will be made accessible
         Locking /agent/hardware/pci/vendor and
         /agent/hardware/pci/vendor/device will, in the same manner, result
         in a set of devices being made accessible.

         Locking /agent/hardware/pci/vendor is necessary for SRIOV support,
         because normally one would like to access VFs just created.
