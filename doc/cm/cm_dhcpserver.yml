         DHCP server enabling/disabling.

         DHCP server operates in three term areas: its clients, which may
         obtain some resources, resource configured for particular
         clients and resources really distributed within clients.
         Thus CM for DHCP server requires three kind of subtrees:
         client-oriented, configuration-oriented (hosts & groupt)
         and lease-oriented to make CM more convinient for particular
         purposes.
