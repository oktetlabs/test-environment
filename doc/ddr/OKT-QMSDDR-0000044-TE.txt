ANNOTATION
Test Engine logging facilities are:
* script to be used by Dispatcher to initialize the raw log;
* script which should be used by Dispatcher and Builder in exclusive mode
  for logging of string messages and files;
* library to be used by TE subsystems for logging string messages, 
  files and memory dumps;
* process listening TEN user requests and polling Test Agents;
* scripts to be used by Dispatcher to initialize and shutdown the Logger.

All this areas should be clarified according to HLD template.

Configuration file parsing issues (when the file is parsed, is some
intermediate representation assumed, etc.) should be clarified as well.
