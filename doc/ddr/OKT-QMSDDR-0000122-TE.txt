ANNOTATION

The document or its part will not be used as source code. NDN parser should
generate some functions/structures to handle CSAP parameters, packet
templates, packet patterns and binary packets. These functions and
structures are protocol stack-specific and depend on NDN for the stack.
However, some exemples, conventions, skeletons, etc. are desirable
to estimate usability and fullness of API. 

From other hand, these templates may be considered as requirements for 
NDN parser. Moreover, they may be used by designer of multi-language EL 
interfaces (C, C++, PERL, TCL), which should provide his/her own 
requirements to NDN parser designer as well.

Source code should be accompanied by rich comments.
