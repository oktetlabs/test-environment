ANNOTATION

Network communication library should provide following functionality to 
RCF TA-specific external libraries:
* connect to Test Agent;
* send command to Test Agent;
* check for pending answer;
* receive an answer;
* destroy connection.

It is assumed that command and answers are strings finished by '\0'. 
In the debugging mode (which is switched on by pre-processor directive) 
it is allowed to mark end of command/answer by '\n'. 
Note, that end marker is considered as part of the command/answer.

Sender of command or answer specifies length of data as a parameter,
i.e. library should never analyze data which it sends. In fact,
the sender may send a command by two "send" calls. However the situation
is bit more complex on receive.
 
The library should read symbols from connection until '\0' (or '\n') 
is received. After that it should analyze received command/answer to 
determine if it contains an attachment. A command/answer contains attachment 
if it is finished by "attach N" substring where N is non-negative integer 
in string representation. For example:

put_file /tmp/pkt attach 180\n

If the library finds attachment it reads N bytes after '\0' (or '\n') 
and puts them to the same user buffer (after command/answer).

User should be informed about following abnormal situations:

1. Buffer provided by user is too small for the command/answer. In this case:  
   * part of command/answer should be returned; 
   * some unique return code should be indicated.
      
2. Buffer provided by user is too small for the attachment. In this case:
   * command/answer and part of attachment should be returned; 
   * some unique return code different from error code used for the 
     situation described above should be indicated;
   * user should be informed about whole length of the attachment.
   
3. Network (socket) problems. Appropriate error should be returned.

It is allowed to call "receive" primitive several times
if the attachment is big. In this case command/answer itself is returned 
only once (first time); only attachment pieces should be returned on 
subsequent calls.

Interface of communication libraries on the TEN is arbitrary.
It is allowed to assume in interface function prototypes that transport
is TCP. However not assumptions should be done about version of IP protocol.
