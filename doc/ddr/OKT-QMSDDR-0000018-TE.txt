TITLE
Communication Subsystem: interfaces, services, protocol (part 2)

PURPOSE
The document should contain overview of TE Communication Subsystem 
traffic generation/receiving issues. Idea is to perform preliminary
research - the document will be re-used later in interface specification,
high level design and protocol specification documents.

ANNOTATION
The document should contain:
  description of services provided by Communication Subsystem to tests and
  other subsystems of TE;
  specification of all interfaces (for example, API);
  specification of related protocol commands;
  implementation issues.
  
Document should discuss traffic generation/receiving functions and
commands only.

Moreover document should discuss:
  format of packet template and filter template for arbitrary stacks;
  format of real packets and real filters description (including
    regular expressions and automatic correct/incorrect field 
    calculation - for example, for checksums);
  packet and filter parsing issues;
  packet fragmentation issues;
  raw and usual modes.
  
Examples should be provided for ethernet, ipv4.ethernet, udp.ipv4.ethernet,
tcp.ipv4.ethernet and CLI.

DETAILS
  It's not necessary to describe types or specify exact format of functions.
  However all parameters, side effects, returned values as well as
  blocking issues should be described.
  For every command format, parameters and response should be described.
  Information storage and memory issues (where parameters/response 
  are stored and how they are passed between Communication Subsystem and
  its user) should be described.
  Several approaches for packet and filters format may be proposed.
  It's allowed to provide example in separate files.
  CSAP implementation on Test Agents should be described as well.
