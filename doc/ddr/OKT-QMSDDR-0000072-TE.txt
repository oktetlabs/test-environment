ANNOTATION
This document should describe issues related to backup creation, verification
and restoring. Two cases should be discussed:
* it is possible to restore backup issuing "configure" commands to 
  the Test Agent (usually);
* it is not possible to restore backup issuing "configure" commands to
  the Test Agent and it's necessary to reboot it.

Processing of both cases is responsibility of the Configurator, but
algorithms are different.
