TITLE
Communication Subsystem: interfaces, services, protocol (part 1)

PURPOSE
The document should contain overview of TE Communication Subsystem 
issues except traffic generation/receiving functionality.
Idea is to perform preliminary research - the document will be re-used 
later in interface specification, high level design and protocol 
specification documents.

ANNOTATION
The document should contain:
  description of services provided by Communication Subsystem to tests and
  other subsystems of TE;
  specification of all interfaces (for example, API);
  specification of related protocol commands;
  implementation issues.
  
Document should not discuss traffic generation/receiving functions and
commands.

DETAILS
  It's not necessary to describe types or specify exact format of functions.
  However all parameters, side effects, returned values as well as
  blocking issues should be described.
  For every command format, parameters and response should be described.
  Information storage and memory issues (where parameters/response 
  are stored and how they are passed between Communication Subsystem and
  its user) should be described.
  Moreover, interpretation of all commands by UNIX, VxWorks and Quantum
  Test Agents should be proposed.
