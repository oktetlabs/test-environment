ANNOTATION
The Storage library should provide to user unified access to some persistent
storage (file system, CVS, etc.). Ideally it should provide the same
functionality as standard input/output library. Moreover, if it is
possible, access to files in the storage should be provided by functions
from stdio library. In this case C header should just contain list
of supported functions from stdio with comments describing which values 
are allowed for arguments of particular function. Otherwise (if standard
interface to storage couldn't be implemented) at least following
functionality should be supported:
* open file/directory
* close file/directory
* check EOF
* flush
* seek
* getc, gets, putc, puts
* formatted output
* remove file/directory
* obtain directory content.
