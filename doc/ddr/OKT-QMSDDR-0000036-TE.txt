ANNOTATION
The document should describe all aspects of Test Coverage Estimation for
Test Environment, particularly:
* what changes should be done in existing tool for source modification
  to use interface provided by Logger to Test Agents;
* how the situation may be resolved if tested software has no common 
  address space with software using logging library (for example, UNIX
  software is tested);
* interface provided by TCE module to Builder to temporary replacing
  of native files in NUT source tree to modified ones;
* functionality required from Report Generator tool to extract
  TCE-related log from raw log;
* script provided by TCE module to Dispatcher for obtaining of TCE value;
* configuration parameters of TCE module and recommendation how
  they may be inserted to Builder configuration file.
  
The HLD should comply to many documents. Most of them are created
simultaneously with HLD. When lack of information is observed
author is allowed to make some assumptions which should be verified
after creation of all related documents.
