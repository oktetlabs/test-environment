ANNOTATION
The document should contain:
  description of interfaces provided by Logging Subsystem to other TE
  subsystems and tests;
  description of interface provided by Logging Subsystem to software
  on Test Agents.
  
  Logging Subsystem on the Test Engine should allow both early logging 
(i.e. before any building) and testing time logging. Moreover, 
C, C++, PERL and TCL interfaces should be supported.
  Logging Subsystem on the Test Agents is a library which provides 
some functions to Test Agents and collects log messages which periodically
requested by Test Agent via "get log" command. Thus at least C interface
should be supported. Note that high performance and trace reliability
is assumed for logging on Test Agents: trace macros should be very fast
and messages should not be lost or re-ordered.
   Possibility of many processes/threads should be taken in account on
both Test Engine and Test Agent sides.

DETAILS
   It's desired but not required to provide strict type definitions and
functions/macros prototypes at least for C interfaces.
