ANNOTATION

IPC library should provide reliable datagram-oriented communication service
for several processes on the single station. One server and many clients
architecture is assumed. 

Both client and server should initialize a library for themself before using.
They provide unique name to the library. Initizlization routine should return 
a file descriptor appropriate for using as a parameter in select() call.

Following functionality should be provided to server:
* receive a message from client (this procedure may block);
* obtain unique identifier of the message sender, which may be used 
  for sending of answer;
* send an answer to client.

Following functionality should be provided to client:
* send a message to the server with specified name and wait an answer;
* send a message to the server with specified name without blocking (only
  once; the next message may be sent after receiving of answer only);
* receive an answer from the server with specified name. 
* send a message, which does not assume an answer, to the server with 
  specified name.
  
Problems may occur for UDP implementation of IPC: it should be possible
to identify server which client wants to send message to. It's
not desirable to use hard-coded ports.
