ANNOTATION
In fact the document should consist of 2 parts which will be copied
to two different headers during implementation:
* interface provided by Logger to TE subsystems and tests (allowing
  put string log messages, dump memory and files);
* interface provided by Logger to Test Agents and software under test
  (allowing put string log messages, dump memory).

Macros providing static filtering of log (on compilation time) should
be defined as well for both interfaces.

Moreover document should describe script-based interface, which will be used
by DIspatcher and Builder before Logger is started. Note that this script
will be used from one context only and therefore it's not necessary
to protect data. Script-based interface should allow:
* initialize raw log file;
* put log messages and dump files;
* close raw log file.
