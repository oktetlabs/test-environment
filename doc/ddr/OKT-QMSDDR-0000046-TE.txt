ANNOTATION
Logger should provide following facilities to Test Agent and software under
test (if Test Agent runs on the operating system with shared address space):
* log string messages;
* dump memory;
* pre-define format strings to avoid copiing during logging (for speed
  sensitive entities);
* mark log by unique user names;
* split log to different levels and prohibit logging of messages with priorities
  lower than specified log level (this feature should be supported
  using pre-processor macros only and is opaque for Logger on the TEN).
  
All this areas should be clarified according to HLD template.
  
Data protection issues, interaction with Logger on the Test Engine, 
portability and performance issues should be discussed in as well.
