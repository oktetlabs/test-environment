| sniffer         | Instance which captures packets on a given interface   |
| sniffer name    | A human-readable sniffer name which identifies it      |
|                 | across the sniffers running on particular interface    |
| sniffer session | Continous session of packets sniffing.                 |
| sniffer ssn     | Sniffer session sequence number. Is an integer uniq    |
|                 | across the agent sniffer sessions and is incremented   |
|                 | upon sniffer creation/reenabling.                      |
|                 | *NOTE*: this means that *sniffer ssn* counter is not   |
|                 | reset when agent is restarted.                         |
| sniffer id      | A sniffer ID which identifies the sniffer across       |
|                 | all the sniffers of a particular agent. Is uniq across |
|                 | the agent lifetime. Is formed as:                      |
|                 | *ifname* ## *sniffer_name* ## *sniffer_ssn*            |
| full sniffer id | A sniffer ID which identifies the sniffer across all   |
|                 | the sniffers existing in the system. Formed as:        |
|                 | *agent_name* ## *sniffer_id*                           |
| agent id        | An identifier of the agent runnin on the test host.    |
|                 | It's tolerant to agent restarts. Several agents with   |
|                 | the same name running on the same host under the same  |
|                 | user *MUST* have different *agent id*.                 |
|                 |                                                        |

* Conventions

Terms in *bold* like *sniffer id* mean exactly what is written in the
definition in the *Terminology* section.

* Introduction

Test Environment is a distributed system which has test agents running on
different hosts each managing several network interfaces. During the tests
execution various network packets are transmitted via the interfaces. The
main purpose of the developed framework is to provide infrastructure for
sniffing on the network interfaces and storing information about the packets
sent/received there.

Although the dumps are keps as binary *.pcap* files the framework is also
responsible for merging the packets dumps/data into various XML/HTML/Text
logs produced by the *TE* and handled by the *RGT* subsystem.

Apart from certain modifications in the existing TE subsystems the sniffer
framework introduces a new object called *sniffer*. It's a separate process
running on the *test agent* side and responsible for capturing the packets
and passing the packet data to the *test agent*.

It should be clear that the actual packets capturing may happen on a
different host/station and the test agent may be just a proxy agent. In this
case sniffer will be provided with an interface to retrieve the packets data
from the IUT.

* Standards

The sniffer framework uses the first version of the *pcap* format. Details

| REQ-00100 | Sniffer should provide ability to sniff packets on a given network      |
|           | interface.                                                              |
| REQ-00120 | Sniffer framework should be fool-safe, so regardless of the             |
|           | configuration the framework should not utilize all the space            |
|           | available on a certain partition.                                       |
| REQ-00130 | Sniffer framework should be capable of surviving a full night run       |
|           | of the existing test suites.                                            |
| REQ-00200 | Sniffer configuration should be performed via Configurator              |
|           | interface.                                                              |
| REQ-00210 | It should be possible to perform per-interface sniffer                  |
|           | configuration.                                                          |
| REQ-00211 | It should be possible to run multiple sniffers on the same              |
|           | interface.                                                              |
| REQ-00215 | Re-configuring on the one sniffer instances should not affect           |
|           | work of other sniffer instances.                                        |
| REQ-00220 | Sniffer configuration should be rolled back as a result of              |
|           | overall configuration rollback performed by configurator                |
|           | upon test completion. I.e. sniffer configuration parameters             |
|           | should not be volatile.                                                 |
| REQ-00222 | It should be possible to perform a run-time packets filtering.          |
| REQ-00223 | Maximum packet capture size should be configurable. See '-s'            |
|           | tcpdump option for details.                                             |

| REQ-00230 | Multi-agent configuration should be supported. Multiple agents can      |
|           | run on the same host. The logs from different sniffers should not       |
|           | be merged or corrupted.                                                 |
| REQ-00240 | Logs should be taken from the agent in a periodic manner to prevent     |
|           | size quotas dearth.                                                     |
| REQ-00241 | Logs should be taken from the agent in a raw format (w/o text/xml       |
|           | preprocessing).                                                         |
| REQ-00242 | Logger should be responsible for periodic logs intake.                  |
| REQ-00243 | Frequency of the logs intake should be configurable in the logger       |
|           | configuration.                                                          |
| REQ-00244 | The logs intake should keep the individual packets consistency -        |
|           | partially written packets should not be taken.                          |
| REQ-00270 | Sniffer should survive agent death and restart. Some packet entries     |
|           | may be lost but the sniffing should continue.                           |
| REQ-00271 | (optional) Packets capturing should continue while agent is             |
|           | restarted.                                                              |
| REQ-00280 | TEN-side capture files control should be supported.                     |
| REQ-00281 | TEN-side capture files naming should be configurable. Automatic         |
|           | names should be selected if no preconfiguration was done.               |
| REQ-00282 | On the TEN side it should be possible to split packets across           |
|           | several files.                                                          |
| REQ-00283 | It should be possible to configure maximum capture size for the         |
|           | TEN-side capture file.                                                  |
| REQ-00284 | (optional)In case of logs separation across several files on the        |
|           | TEN-side it should be possible to configure an overall available        |
|           | space.                                                                  |

| REQ-00286 | (optional)In case of limited file sizes on the TEN side different       |
|           | methods of the overfill hadling should be supported:                    |
|           | * rotation;                                                             |
|           | * drop of the tail packets;                                             |
| REQ-00287 | TEN-side capture file path should be configurable.                      |
| REQ-00290 | Agent side temporary files handling should be configurable.             |
| REQ-00291 | Agent side log rotation should be supported and configurable.           |

| REQ-00296 | In case of limited temporary files on the agent side different          |
|           | methods of the overfill handling should be supported:                   |
|           | * rotation (when the packets in the head are lost);                     |
|           | * tail drop (when the packets in the tail are lost).                    |
| REQ-00300 | API for sniffer/filters configuraiton should be available from the      |
|           | test.                                                                   |

| REQ-00302 | It should be possible to modify filter settings for a sniffer           |
|           | which is in disabled state. For enabled sniffer the operation           |
|           | should be terminated with EBUSY.                                        |
| REQ-00303 | API should be provided to test to generate a 'separator' mark           |
|           | (special rare packet) into the sniffer capture. All traffic             |
|           | that may be generated by the test after this operation should           |
|           | be after the mark in the capture.                                       |
| REQ-00304 | It should be possible to disable from test an externally-configured     |
|           | sniffer which was not forced. See REQ-0031* for details.                |
| REQ-00310 | It should be possible to configure the sniffer from the                 |
|           | run.sh/dispatcher.sh command line. This includes:                       |

| REQ-00311 | Command line option to run sniffers on all interfaces owned by the      |
|           | test configuration should be added.                                     |
| REQ-00312 | (optional) Command line option to run sniffers on all interfaces        |
|           | used by a certain test should be supported.                             |
| REQ-00313 | Command line option to disable all sniffers (even those explicitly      |
|           | configured by the tests) should be added.                               |
| REQ-00314 | Even if the test disables the externally-configured sniffers (see       |
|           | REQ-00304) it should be possible to force the sniffer for a             |
|           | particular test (something like forced-sniffer should be impelemented). |
| REQ-00320 | It should be possible to obtain capture logs corresponding to           |
|           | the particular test.                                                    |

| REQ-00323 | Per-test capture files creation should be possible. By default these    |
|           | per-test files should be stored on the engine machine in the caps/      |
|           | directory (see also REQ-00287).                                         |
| REQ-00324 | In case of separation from REQ-00323 Test log name should be logged     |

| REQ-00500 | PCAP format should be used for captures storing. Both on agent          |
|           | and on TEN side.                                                        |
| REQ-00510 | Conversion from the pcap format to the RGT XML format should be         |
|           | implemented.                                                            |
| REQ-00513 | It should be possible to enable/disable resulution of ports to          |
|           | service names during pcap to XML conversion.                            |
| REQ-00515 | Merging of the generated xml-log (see REQ-00510) with the test xml      |
|           | logs should be supported. In case of several captures it shoulbe        |
|           | clear where the logged packet was sniffed (agent, interface etc.)       |
| REQ-00600 | Agent-side of the sniffer framework implementation MUST NOT use any     |
|           | GPL libraries. The libraries list should be explicit and must be        |
|           | reviewed by the RESPMGR.                                                |
| REQ-00700 | Sniffer configuration via the package.xml should be supported.          |
| REQ-00701 | The sniffer configuration done at certain level in the package.xml      |
|           | should be inherited by the lower levels.                                |
| REQ-00702 | The sniffer configuration done via package.xml can be overwritten by:   |
|           | * the internal test logic;                                              |

The framework has the following 'parts':
  1. *sniffer* - sniffer itself as an instance for packets capturing and
     storing them into temporary capture files. As it's clear from the REQs
     there can be several sniffers running on the same host/interface with
     different options.
  2. Part of the agent which provides interface to the sniffer for
     starting/stopping/configuration and logs retrieving.
  3. Packet dumps intake subsystem located on the Logger, it's also
     responsible for storing the logs into specific capture (*.pcap*) files
     on the *TEN* side.
  4. RGT component which converts *pcap* files into XML format which can be
     handled by the *rgt-conv* tool.

* Product services

Sniffer framework provides:
  - means for TE to get information about the packets running through the
    network interfaces across the test configuration and include this info
    into resulting TE run artifacts (HTML/XML/Text logs, auxiliary dumps etc.);
  - means for the end user to get capture files for the interfaces under TE
    jurisdiction.

* Utilised services

1. Sniffer framework uses *Configurator* as it's only configuration
   interface. Configurator is also responsible for sniffer configuration
   restoration upon test completion or agent restart. It's important to note
   that although the agent may die the sniffing process should not stop or
   interrupt.

2. The resulting *pcap* files on the TEN side are converted to XML which is
   passed directly to RGT.

3. *RCF* is used as the only transport mechanism. No direct file coping is
   performed.

Some notes:

1) The /--sniff-ta/ options affect all sniffers running on the agent of the
   latest sniffer in the command line.

2) /--sniff-ta/ options defaults are agent-specific.

**** Capture files access serialization

As both *agent* and *sniffer* work with temporary capture files it's
important to serialize their access. The system uses files system locks
implemented using *fcntl* mechanism. Sniffer does not read the capture
files, so it only uses *write* lock. Note, that the sniffer must take the
write lock for every packet addition and upon releasing it *MUST* ensure
that there are no partial packets in the file. The agent takes the *read
lock* to caclulate the maximum offset in the capture file.

*NOTE*: *MUST* use fcntl, not *flock*!

**** Agent-sniffer calls API

*** Configurator subtrees

Two new configuration subtrees are added to the agent configuration model.    

Generic configuration subtree /agent/sniffer_settings/ which represents
agent-wide sniffer configuration (configuration paths, overfill handling
logic etc.), see the requirements doc for the detailed list.

|-----------------------------------------------+------------------------------|

Plus a per-interface /agent/interface/sniffer/ subtree which is responsible
for configuration of a specific sniffer instances is added. In future we may
have a settings overwrite mechanism which will allow sniffer-wide settings
to overwrite /agent/sniffer_settings/ part.  Each sniffer instance in the
configurato subtree has a *sniffer name* which is by design (cause it's a
name of the object instance) uniq across the interface.

*NOTE*: 
  - If the same settings declarated in both subtrees (file_size, 
    overfill_type, snaplen), use the one that declarated in the interface tree.
  - *sniffer_space*, *file_size* and *rotation* are restricting the parameters.
    By default this parameters means that sniffer capture files can take no 
    more than 64Mb space on the disk, size of the one file can not exceed 
    16 Mb and can be created not more than 4 files.

*** RCF protocols and API

**** RCF API
The RCF API is extended to support two new calls.

1. *rcf_get_sniffers(agent, sniffer_id)*

   *sniffer id* is optional argument, it may be NULL. It used if required to 
   get offset of last capdtured packet of the sniffer, when you need to put 
   a marker.

   Returns list of sniffers which have non-empty captures. For each sniffer
   it returns:
     - *sniffer_id*;
     - if the argument *sniffer_id* not NULL:
        - absolute offset of last captured packet for the sniffer;
        - the list of sniffers will be consist of a single unit.
     - else
        - value of absolute offset is zero.

   Sniffers are named with *sniffer id*. We can safely assume
   that there exists the maximum number of sniffers on the agent which is
   *32* and pass a static array.

2. *rcf_get_sniffer_dump(agent, sniffer_id)*

   Get integral number of packets catched up by the *sniffer_id* on the
   *agent*. It returns service data:
   - absolute offset of the first byte of the first packet in the
     current partition;
   - name of the saved file by RCF;
   - name of the saved file on the *Agent* side.

The only user of this calls is *Logger*. Both calls are synchronous.

**** RCF data transmition protocols
1. For the function *rcf_get_sniffers* to transmit list of sniffers used
   following protocol. List of sniffers packed into the buffer. For each
   sniffer used next text format:
   <Sniffer name> <Interface name> <SSN> <offset>\0

2. For the function *rcf_get_sniffer_dump* to transmit the sniffer id to
   *agent* used following protocol. Sniffer ID packed into a string with the
   following format:
   <Sniffer name> <Interface name> <SSN>\0

3. The function *rcf_get_sniffer_dump* returns a service data. These data
   packed into a string with the following format, separator is the symbol
   combination <.pcap>:
   <Current capture file name (ends by *.pcap*)><Absolute offset>

*** Logger IPC interface

*** Sniffer backends interface

* Data model definition

** Agent-specific folder

Each agent has a uniq *agent id*. It creates a separate folder in the */tmp*
directory - */tmp/agent_id*. It may store any agent-specific data which
should survive across agent restart.

Reason some of the data is not suitable to be stored in the Configurator is
cause if the data is modified by the agent it must be volatile. Thus it
won't be restored by the Configurator after agent restart.

** Sniffer SSN

Sniffer session sequence number is a uniq integer which identifies the
sniffer across all the sniffers of the agent. The ID is agent-life-time
valid which means that it survives agent restart.

To establish an SSN for the newly started sniffer the agent uses
*/tmp/agent_id/next_sniffer_ssn* file which stores the exact SSN value. The
value in the file is incremented every time it's read. As the file is not
cleaned up on agent restart it will continue to grow across the entire TE
run.

If the file is absent a zero SSN should be selected and one should be
written to the file.

** Sniffer directory

The agent has a *<sniffers_path>* which is a boot-time variable. By default
it is */tmp/agent_id/*, so sniffer stores all the data in the agent-specific
directory.

It's possible (via Configurator) to specify a different logs directory. This
is usefull in case we'd like to store significant amount of data (much more
then the /tmp directory size).

Sniffer stores all it's data in the *<sniffers_path>/sniffers/sniffer_id*
directory.

If *<sniffer_path>* is set the user should be carefull as it may intercect
with other test runs.

*FIXME*: may be it's reasonable to specify agent-specific folder path?

*** Sniffer files naming

Each sniffer has several capture files. Exact number of files depend on the
rotation settings.

File name has *fixed width*. It starts with the absolute offset of the first
byte in the first packet of the file followed by an underscore and a file
rotation number. The File has *.pcap* extension.

Example: 000000239239_5.pcap

** Sniffers list

The agent keeps a list of the sniffers it's handling. On the agent start it
determines if any sniffers are already running (by looking into the
*<sniffers_path>/sniffers/* directory. If so - it forms a list of sniffers
basing on the content of the directory.

The list of sniffers present in the Configurator subtree is not enought as
the interface may have been gone while the Logger is still reading the logs.

Sniffers in the list are identified by *sniffer_id*. For each sniffer the
agent keeps:
  - absolute offset of the next packet to be sent to the Logger;
  - the current capture filename; 
  - the offset of the next packet to be read from the capture file.

The filename/offset are stored in *<sniffers_path>/sniffers/sniffer_id/file*
and *<sniffers_path>/sniffers/sniffer_id/offset* files. Note that the file
may become invalid as the sniffer may asynchronously rotate the logs
removing the oldest dump. Such situation should be detected and the offset
should be reset to zero.

The absolute offset can be calculated as the relative offset plus the
absolute file offset (stored in the filename).

** Logger configurations

Logger subsystem can be configured from XML file. By default used
*logger.conf* from the *conf/* directory. The list of settings is described
below.
|-------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Setting name                  | Description                          |
|-------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
|snif_fname                     | Template dump file name.             |
|snif_path                      | Path of dump files folder.           |
|                               | By default: TE_LOG_DIR/caps          |
|snif_max_fsize                 | Max file size for one sniffer.       |
|                               | By default: unlimited.               |
|snif_space                     | Max total capture files size for     |
|                               | one sniffer. By default: unlimited.  |
|snif_rotation                  | Rotate logger side temporary logs    |
|                               | across *x* files for each sniffer.   |
|snif_overall_size              | Max total files size for all sniffers|
|                               | By default: unlimited.               |
|snif_ovefill_meth              | Overfill handel method:              |
|                               | 0 - rotation(default)                |
|                               | 1 - tail drop.                       |
|snif_period                    | Period of taken logs from agents.    |
|                               | By default:                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|

* Processes

Each sniffer on the agent side is running in a separate process. Reasons
are:
  * it should survive agent's death/restart;
  * experience shows that the agent behaviour is much more stable when such
    services are separated into a separate process.

In case the sniffer unexpectedly dies it *MUST* be restarted, but a clear
*ERROR* message should be logged describing what sniffer died and how.

* Events processing

Sniffer process should handle interface disappearance. It should complete and
should not report an error. Such situations are pretty common. If the
interface disappearance was unexpected - this should be detected by other
agent subsystems.

*NOTE*: even if the interface will reappear in a second the sniffer must get
a new SSN, so there is no point in keeping it running.

* Configuration parameters

*FIXME helen*: it's not clear what should go here. Part of Interfaces
section should definitely be moved here, but only Helen knows which one.

* Initialization and shutdown

** Agent start

The *RCF* can distinguish two agent startup scenarios:
  - bootstrap start;
  - agent restart (regular or caused by agent death).

In the first case RCF should initiate a special 'bootstrap' procedure which
should cleanup all the files which are left from the previous execution of
the agent on this test configuration.

Things which should be cleaned up during the agent bootstrap sequence is
the agent-specific folder which may include:
  - sniffer SSN selector;
  - old sniffers capture files;
  - per-sniffer read offset.

* Algorithms

** Logger polling process

Logger has the list of test agents which it uses for polling them for the
text logs. Similar logic is used for packet dumps retreiving.

For each agent the Logger first asks it for this list of sniffers with the
*rcf_get_sniffers* function call. After that for each sniffer it calls
*rcf_get_sniffer_dump* to get a certain number of logs. The call informs the
Logger if there are any more logs to download.

Logger perform a round-robin for selection of the sniffer to call
*rcf_get_sniffer_dump*.

** Logger overfill handle process


** Agent side rcf_get_sniffers handle implementaition

*rcf_get_sniffers(agent, sniffer_id)* is called by Logger to get sniffers 
list from the *agent*.

If *sniffer_id* is not NULL the agent should:
  1. Find newest capture file in the directory. Update the absolute offset 
     value stored for the sniffer by the value from the log filename.
  2. Take the file system lock (with fcntl).
  3. Get maximum file offset (note, that at this point the offset will
     include only full packets).
  4. Release the lock and close the file.
  5. Outgrowth the absolute offset value by current file offset value.
  6. Send answer to the Logger. List of sniffers will be consist of the single 
     sniffer with current absolute offset.

In case than *sniffer_id* is NULL, absolute offset value for the 
corresponding sniffer will be equal zero. In this case the agent should send 
full list of the sniffers.

** Agent side *rcf_get_sniffer_dump* implementation.

*rcf_get_sniffer_dump(agent, sniffer_id)* is called by the Logger to get the
next portion of the captured packets.

Assert that we have a sniffer with such name.

To handle the call the agent directly accesses the sniffer capture
files. Several things should be taken into account:
  - it's possible that the sniffer is writing the capture file in the very
    moment of RCF call; agent must not return partial packets;
  - sniffer can delete the capture file because of the rotation procedure.
  - sniffer should transmit to the Logger all existing packets from the current 
    file.

So the agent should:

  1. Check if the current file stored in the sniffer list still exists.
  2. If it's not:
    1. Find the oldest capture file in the directory.
    2. Get the absolute offset value stored for the sniffer by the
       value from the capture filename.
    3. Set the current capture filename to the name of the oldest file. Reset
       the local file offset to zero.
    4. Forward log message.
  Next steps for existing file:
  3. Take the file system lock (with fcntl).
  4. Get maximum file offset (note, that at this point the offset will
     include only full packets).
  5. Release the lock so the sniffer can write into the file. But don't close
     the file so there is still a reference to it and it can't be removed.
  6. Send the data (nessesary amount or up to the end of the file)
     by *sendfile()* function.
  7. Adjust local and absolute *offset* values.
  8. If EOF is reached and it's not the only capture file in the sniffer
     directory (means that sniffer is not writing into it at the moment) -
     close it and remove.

** Insert a mark packet process.

*log_sniffer_mark_insert(sniffer_id id, const char* description)* is called 
by the Test to insert mark packet into the sniffer capture file.

The Logger should:
  1. Call the fuction *rcf_get_sniffers(agent, sniffer_id)*, sniffer_id should
     not be NULL. The Logger gets the sniffer list whith absolute offset 
     values of last captured packet of the sniffer.
  2. The value offset for certain sniffer saves.
  3. When it reaches an absolute offset of recived packets equal to the stored
     value is inserted mark packet.

** Algorithm to get sniffers logs.
*** Sniffer log thread under the Logger.
  To provide periodic manner pull outs sniffers logs Logger process create 
  a new *sniffers handler* thread for each *Agent*. This thread should obtain 
  and manage sniffers logs from the agent. To get the logs for each agent 
  should performed some calls sequence described below.

*** Calls sequence to get sniffers logs.
  This calls performed for each agent:
  1. Call the fuction *rcf_get_sniffers*. The argument *sniffer_id* should
     be NULL.
  2. The function *rcf_get_sniffers* performed call of the *RCF API* function 
     *send_recv_rcf_ipc_message*. It's for transmit the message to the *RCF* 
     subsystem and get the answer with buffer of the sniffer list.
  3. *RCF* in it's turn transmit message to the agent. Here the message 
     handling by the *rcf_pch* functions.
  4. On the agent side is called the function *rcf_ch_get_sniffers*, which gets 
     the list of sniffers. And then send answer with a binary attach of buffer
     with the list of sniffers to the *RCF* subsystem of *TEN*.
  5. The binary attach with the list of sniffers is transmited from *RCF* 
     subsystem to the *sniffers handler* thread of the Logger process by
     message.
  6. The function *rcf_get_sniffers* helpful *send_recv_rcf_ipc_message* gets
     the buffer of the sniffer list and returned it to the *sniffers handler*
     function as output parameters.

  For each sniffer performed next calls:
  1. Call the fuction *rcf_get_sniffer_dump*. It's again call of the *RCF API* 
     function *send_recv_rcf_ipc_message*.
  2. Second and third steps is analogue to corresponding steps in the previous 
     describing of the calls. But the answer will be contains a file name of 
     recived log and absolute offset of the first byte of the first packet in 
     the current partition.
  3. See the previous step.
  4. After got the message on the agent side is called the function 
     *rcf_ch_get_sniffer_logs*, wich performed actions decribed in the
     *Agent side *rcf_get_sniffer_dump* implementation* section. And then send
     answer with a binary attach of buffer with the sniffer capture log to 
     the *RCF* subsystem of *TEN*.
  5. The *RCF* subsystem saves that attach as a temporary file. Information 
     about recived capture log file and offset is transmitted to the 
     *sniffers handler* thread of the Logger process by message.
  6. The fuction *rcf_get_sniffer_dump* gets the service information about the
     cpature log and returned it to the *sniffers handler* function as output
     parameters.

* Integration issues

*FIXME*: bootstrap start/shutdown (RCF side)
  <sniffer_path> directory
*FIXME*: bootstrap/cleanup hooks on the agent
*FIXME*: agent ID

* Source organization
* Alternative decisions and design tradeoffs
  
 - locks vs. pcap parsing

 - TEN side test-based separation (RGT vs. Logger)

 - dispatcher options processing (at the moment of the configurator startup
   there may be no interface)

  - Agent side *rcf_get_sniffers(agent, sync)* (fseek vs fstat).
