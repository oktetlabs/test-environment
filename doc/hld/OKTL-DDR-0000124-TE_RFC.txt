TITLE 
# Title of document should be specified here by DDR creator.
Test Environment Router Filter CSAP Design Document

PURPOSE 
# Purpose of document creation/update should be specified here.
# This may be for example: 
#   estimations, proposals or research for external or internal customer;
#   design or test specification for the some project;
#   internal standard;
#   user guide or reference manual.
The main purpose of this document is designing of test cases for L5 ip-dev project.

#AUDIENCE
# This section is optional if the document already exists.
# Possible document readers (customers, possible partners, end users, 
# engineers, coders) should be specified here.
TE development team and QA manager.

#ACCESS
# This section is optional if the document already exists.
# Specify here the level of confidentiality of the document: 
# how it may be distributed (to particular customers, to particular
# company employees, to all company employees, unrestricted, etc.)

#COMPLY
# This section is optional.
# List here all documents (or part of documents) to which 
# the document or its new parts should comply. For example:
#   project requirements document;
#   standards;
#   some existing or future HLD documents.

ANNOTATION
# Specify here what document or its new parts should describe.
# The size and quality of the annotation depends on 
# DDR author's laziness only, but he/she should understand
# that he/she will receive what he/she has ordered. :)
# If diagrams are desirable, don't forget to mention about it.

Router Filter CSAP functionality and implementation design should be described.

Router Filter CSAP should have the following functionality:
1. Forward all incoming traffic to one of ethernet port to other ethernet port.
2. Filter incoming packets by the following criteries:
    1) MAC source/destination addresses;
    2) IP source/destination addresses;
    3) TCP source/destination ports (???).
3. The following operations should be supported for processing of filtered packets.
   (all other packets that do not match the filtering pattern should be forwarded)
    1) delay filtered packets;
    2) drop filtered packets;
    3) reorder filtered packets;
    4) emulate fixed output rate of filtered packets;
4. Configuration on the fly should be supported. 

Optional features:
5. Parsing of all filtered packets and sending of filtering log to tester.
   Log should be in the following format:
    1) parsed packet header, received/sent timestamp, the operations performed
       with the packet (delay/reorder/drop/enqueued)

#DETAILS
# This section is optional.
# Specify here, which detalisation is required for the document.
# For example:
#   black box with provided services description;
#   black box with API specification;
#   main parts (subsystems) descriptions and relations between them;
#   all subsystems description and relations between them;
#   all API of all subsystems;
#   all algorithms and state machines;
#   all external definitions;
#   structure of sources;
#   all internal definitions and functions.

Design document should describe all API of all subsystems of Router Filter CSAP.

1. The method of integration with TE should be described in details
   (will it be standalone implementation or existing Ethernet
    CSAP will be used for receiving packets).

2. Filtering technique functionality and configuration API should be described.

3. There should be a detailed description for each operation and its parameters.

Detailed diagrams are welcomed.


#REFS 
# Useful materials.
# This section is optional.
# Refer here to information items which may help Document Author.

DEADLINE
# Calendar deadline of the document creation/update.
# Usually the responsible manager is the person specifying
# this parameter. However, DDR author may recommend the
# deadline as well as provide the reasons. If Document Author
# is not able to complete the work before deadline,
# he/she should provide Delay Report to Document Requester.
# When DDR is approved by responsible manager this field
# should have format described in RFC3339. For example:
# 2002-05-31

2004-12-06

AUTHOR 
# Document Author.
# This section may appear several times if several authors
# are assigned to the document. The chapter, which should
# be written (updated) by the author, should be specified 
# here as well. 
# This section may be added, changed or removed in any time 
# by Document Requester only.

#NOTES
# This section is optional, but desirable.
# This section should contain description of decisions made by  
# responsible manager about this DDR. 
# Each record should contain a date of the note. 
# The record may contain references to some related information 
# items (for example, Document Review Records).
# Notes should look like this:
#   Author(s) ... is (are) assigned to document creation/update instead ...
#   Review is scheduled on ...
#   Deadline is changed to ...
#   Document is approved at ...
#   Document Development Process is postponed because ...
#   Document Development Process is refused because ...
