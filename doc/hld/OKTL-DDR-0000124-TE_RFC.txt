ANNOTATION

Router Filter CSAP functionality and implementation design should be described.

Router Filter CSAP should have the following functionality:
1. Forward all incoming traffic to one of ethernet port to other ethernet port.
2. Filter incoming packets by the following criteries:
    1) MAC source/destination addresses;
    2) IP source/destination addresses;
    3) TCP source/destination ports (???).
3. The following operations should be supported for processing of filtered packets.
   (all other packets that do not match the filtering pattern should be forwarded)
    1) delay filtered packets;
    2) drop filtered packets;
    3) reorder filtered packets;
    4) emulate fixed output rate of filtered packets;
4. Configuration on the fly should be supported. 

Optional features:
5. Parsing of all filtered packets and sending of filtering log to tester.
   Log should be in the following format:
    1) parsed packet header, received/sent timestamp, the operations performed
       with the packet (delay/reorder/drop/enqueued)

#DETAILS

Design document should describe all API of all subsystems of Router Filter CSAP.

1. The method of integration with TE should be described in details
   (will it be standalone implementation or existing Ethernet
    CSAP will be used for receiving packets).

2. Filtering technique functionality and configuration API should be described.

3. There should be a detailed description for each operation and its parameters.

Detailed diagrams are welcomed.
