PPPoE server configuration model in TE.

Configuration model:
1) pppoe server subtree should be under the interface node
    /agent/interface/pppoe_server

  This node has only one instance with empty name.
  It represents the pppoe-server running status for the certain interface.
  (1 - pppoe-server is running, 0 - stopped).

  pppoe-server can be configured to operate on several vlans other
  the specific ethernet interface.

  - Get value for this node greps ps utility output for:
    'pppoe-server ... -I <ifname>'.

  - Set method starts/stops pppoe-server daemon

2) To simplify the configuration of pppoe-server, only neccessary parameters
   are added to the configuration tree.

   - Local address parameter (-L option) is representer by local_addr node:
      /agent/interface/pppoe_server/local_addr

   - Remote address parameter (-R option) is representer by remote_addr node:
      /agent/interface/pppoe_server/remote_addr

   - In case pppoe server should operate with ethernet interface other
     several VLANs, vlans parameter is added as a string value:
      /agent/interface/pppoe_server/vlans

     This parameter lists vlan_ids to run pppoe_server daemon on
     using '-I' key. For example:
        /agent:TST1/interface:eth3/pppoe_server:/vlans: = "3 4 5"
     will run 'pppoe-server -I eth3.3 -I eth3.4 -I eth3.5...'

   NOTE: all these parameter are changable only if pppoe-server
         daemon is not runnning, otherwise these parameters are parsed
         from ps tool output.

3) Diagnostics
   It is not neccessary, but should be useful to have status of running pppd
   daemons in the configuration model:

   - /agent/interface/pppd node represents if pppd is running on the specified
     interface (interface can be VLAN in this case).
     This node is read-only and volatile, get method greps output of ps tool.

   - /agent/interface/pppd/pid - pid of the corresponding pppd process running
     other specified interface, get methos is similar to previous one.

   - /agent/interface/pppd/ppp_if - name of ppp interface created other
     specified ethernet interface (w/wo vlan_id). Get methos compares value
     of /var/run/pppdX.pid files with corresponding pid of pppd process.
