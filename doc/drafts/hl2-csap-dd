CSAP type: hl2
purpose: testing of hiperlan2 (?) library


csap_create
    set some configure options in library.
    issue:
	- options are common to the whole library (?), and creation of new CSAP
	  may change them, and traffic operation in others will be performed
	  with these new option values.

csap_destroy
    check if there any data pending to be sent.
    if not, destroy does nothing hl2-specific, only free common-CSAP resources.

trsend_start:
    save data to be sent in CSAP-related queue (mac_get will take them from it),
    call mac_cmd with respective parameters,
    quit from "send" state, answer to test.

trsend_stop never appropriate to this CSAP.

trrecv_start
    set request to data receive for this CSAP in mac_ind function,
    read callback should wait on its individual semaphore which should
    be posted by mac_ind function when it will be called.

This library should implement funcions: mac_ind and mac_get.

All calls of mac_cmd should be protected by "low-busy" semaphore, which should
indicate that some other CSAP calls this functions at this moment or
mac_get or mac_ind are processing.
