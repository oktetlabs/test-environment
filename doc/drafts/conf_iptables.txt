Iptables configuration model in TE.

Goals:
- Configurator should be able to track changes in iptables rules
  made by tests and rollback that changes.
- Configurator should not allow conflicts between different test
  agents running on the host.

Resolving Conflicts:
  To avoid conflicts between different test agents, separate chains
for each interface should be created.
  Each network interface is a resource of test agent and is not shared
with other TAs. Thus operating with per-interface chains only will not
affect other interfaces.
  Сommon (built-in) chains for each table should be duplicated and
corresponding jump rules added (inserted) with interface-only matching.

For example:
  For NAT table and interface eth1 we should create chains: eth1_PREROUTING,
eth1_POSTROUTING and eth1_OUTPUT, and add conditional jumps to PREROUTING,
POSTROUTING and OUTPUT chains of NAT table with intarface matching
(-i for incoming packets, or -o for outgoing)

Configuration Tree Model:
  1) Iptables configuration subtree should be under interface node:
    /agent/interface/iptables/

    Iptables node is not accessible and has no named instances.
    It is created to simplify sync for iptables subtree.

  2) Each table should be represented as standalone instance
  (filter, mangle, nat, raw):
    /agent/interface/iptables/table

  3) Each table has several per-interface chains
    /agent/interface/iptables/table/chain

    Chains instances are not created automatically to avoid a lot of unused chains creation.
    One of the built-in chains should be used as an instance name.
    When instance is added, user-defined chain with <interface>_ prefix is created.
    Chain instance has boolean value that shows whether jump rule is installed or not.

    - Get operation checks whether jump rule is installed by
      grepping 'iptables -t <table> -S' output
    - Set operation adds/deletes to/from common chain jumping
      rule for per-interface chain.
    - List operations returnes list of per-interface chains
      in the corresponding table returned by 'iptables -S' command
      grepping lines started with '-N <interface>_'.

  4) List of rules for each chain is stored as a single string value.
    /agent/interface/iptables/table/chain/rules

    It has only one instance with empty name. There are no named lists of rules.
    All rules are listed with '\n' delimiter.

    - Get operation returns list of rules generated
      by 'iptables -t <table> -S <chain>' command.

    - Set operation flushes the chain and fills up new
      chain rules list with iptables tool.

  5) To avoid operations with plain value of rules list,
     cmd write-only volatile object is introduced.

     /agent/interface/iptables/table/chain/cmd

     This node allows to execute iptables command by setting its value.
     It updates rules list, so sync is required for rules node.
