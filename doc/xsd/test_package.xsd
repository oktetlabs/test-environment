                        Package. If no authors are specified, authors
                        of the parent package are considered as authors
                        of this one.  Hence this field is mandatory for
                        top-level packages only.

                        Compete set of requirements verified by the
                        package. It's assumed that other requirements
                        are not verified by the package including lower
                        level packages. If no requirements are
                        specified for descendant, it's assumed that it
                        verifies this set of requirements. Descendant's
                        set should be a subset of this one. If no
                        requirments are specified, descendants should
                        be analized.
