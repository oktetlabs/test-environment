QUESTION FIXED
General: How safety of configurator handles usage will be guaranteed?

PROPOSAL FIXED
General: It's suggeted to define structure with object identifier
properties/attributes and use it in functions 52, 70, 85. It simplifies
addition of new attributes/properties.

DIRECTION FIXED
8 : Use doxygen style comment @author with e-mail

DIRECTION FIXED
10 : Remove "@(#) "

DIRECTION FIXED
12 : Use prefix for TE-global names. 

QUESTION FIXED
12 : Why the same defintion is used for both sub-identifier maximum length
and instance name maximum length? It's not shown in definition name.

PROPOSAL FIXED
12: It's suggested to have two definitions.

PROPOSAL FIXED
12 : It's suggested to put "MAX", "MIN", "LEN" and "SZ" elements of macro
name at the end of the name.

DIRECTION FIXED
22 : It should not be space between "*" and defined type name.

QUESTION FIXED
25, 29, 30, 52, 97, 116, 125, 133, 153, 272, 281, 292, 300, 310 :
Why 'unsigned' qualifier is used here.

PROPOSAL FIXED
29 : It's suggested to use 'cfg_object_subid' here with macro definition
to access 'subid' field with one step (as field of 'cfg_inst_subid').

QUESTION FIXED
36 : Why 'void *' type is used here?

PROPOSAL FIXED
43, 45, 53, 54 ... : It's suggested to define boolean type in TE and use here.

QUESTION FIXED
47 : May be it's better to use relative object identifiers here?

QUESTION FIXED
47 ... : Have children descriptions already been added to Configurator?

QUESTION FIXED
50 ... : What is status code?

DIRECTION FIXED
52, 70, 133, 141 : Use 'const' qualifier for 'oid' parameter.

DIRECTION FIXED
95, 97 : Synchronize function description and prototype.

PROPOSAL FIXED
97 : Use 'str' instead of 's'.

PROPOSAL FIXED
102, 103 : May be it's better to provide routine to free memory allocated for
'cfg_oid' and does not provide any details to user about malloc(). User should
call routine to free resources allocated for 'cfg_oid'.

DIRECTION FIXED
112, 121: Provide name of the macro which defines the assumed length of the
buffer under the pointer. Don't use 'long enough'.

DIRECTION FIXED
124 : Fix routine name (it's equal to previous one).

PROPOSAL FIXED
131, 139, 159, 167, 175 :
It's suggeted to define macro like 'CFG_HANDLE_INVALID' and use it instead of
NULL.

PROPOSAL FIXED
147, 148, 286 : Use upper case 'OUT'

QUESTION FIXED
151; What is OK?

QUESTION FIXED
153: May be it's faster to use array with cfg_handles on return?

PROPOSAL REJECTED
155, 159, 161 : Use 'child' instead of 'son'.

PROPOSAL REJECTED
171, 175, 177 :Use 'parent' instead of 'father'.

QUESTION REJECTED
189, 210, 223, 237 : May be it's better to use 'void *' instead of '...'

PROPOSAL FIXED
237 : Use 'sync' instead of 's'.

DIRECTION FIXED
250 : Space should be between '*' and type name, not between '(' and '*'

DIRECTION FIXED
250 : Provide a possibility to break enumeration using callback return code.

DIRECTION FIXED
262 : Provide description of 'callback' parameter

DIRECTION FIXED
310 : Fix function name. It's equal to function in line 281
