Minutes of the "Test Environment Architecture" discussion
Date: 2002.12.05; time: 16:00 - 19:00

participants: helen, ibr, renata, arybchik, tema, oleg, konst, art, nicka.

General purpose of meeting was discussion of the document
	TS-OKT-0000021-TEARCH.

The following remarks and wishes was expressed.

- General request: description of TE should be more detailed, there should
  be some more diagrams, arrows on them should be described.

- Identifier "Protocol subsystem" is misleading, more good one is
  "Communication subsystem".

- What programming language should be used.
  TA on NUT sertainly will be written on C, and all the other kinds of TA
  probably too. Different subsystems of TE may be writted on different
  languages, question is left to the next phase of desing.

- Interface between "test" and TE was discussed and this question was
  posponed after discusison interface between TE and TA.

- section 9.1.1. May test reboot NUT? What this action mean? who may perform
  it? what object should be rebooted? The section should be clarified.

- section 9.1.2  Why name and index are separated? Internal structure of
  "current" configuration DB changed to tree, with string identification
  of nodes, so each entry identified by dot-separated sequence of strings.

- When test perform any action (via TA) with NUT changing its configuration,
  it have to notify Congiguration subsystem about it after successful finish
  of this action.

- sections 9.1.3-4  TA is not responsible to watch this process is it finished
  itself.
  Generally, TA has no way to notify TE about something without special request
  from TE, all that TA sends to TE are responses to some requests.

- sections 9.1.9-10 Are these commands really needed?

- sections 9.1.11-12 these commands should be described more accurate.

- Essense of object "NSAP" should be described more detailed. Particulary,
  idea that it is "something like a socket" should be present.

- What is destination of filtered packet? how test will process them?

- Ordef of sections in document is incorrect.

- Build section: may be specify usage of automake/autoconf directly?
  Tema: section 6.1 should be rewritten.

- Ether the entity "global dispatcher of testing process", describe it's
  functionality and draw separate diagram.

- Idea of configuration recovering discussed. Config subsystem should store
  plain snapshots at the beginning of each test package and after it's finish
  check current configuration with respective stored one.

- Initial config DB is not related to TA command "configure".

- Logging subsystem: desctiption of documents to be written is not good.
  Separate document with interface specification should be created.

- Format of specification of packets and filters was discussed.

Tasks:

Helen - improve document "Test Environment Architecture" according
        to the expressed notices.

Oleg, konst - study question of specification of packets and filters and
        try to desing format and write some examples.
