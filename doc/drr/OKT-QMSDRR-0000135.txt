DIRECTION
Wrong macro parameters order.

DIRECTION
Change log_mess to log_message.

PROPOSAL 
Provide short desctiption of format string in LOG macro description.

DIRECTION
Specify that for logging on the engine name of the logging entity
"Engine" or "Test" should be defined by pre-processor directive.

DIRECTION
Specify that log_mess is inline function.

DIRECTION
Prototype of the log_mess should be changed to discover number of
real arguments.

PROPOSAL
Use two buffers: array with fixed-length number referring to
buffer containing strings and memory dumps. If there is no free
space in any of buffer (i.e. TEN gathers log too slow) new one
should be allocated. If memory allocation is impossible (LOG macro
call occurs in interrupt handler) old messages should be destroyed.

DIRECTION
Log level-related macros should be defined.

DIRECTION
Script for log file closing is not described (see DDR).

DIRECTION
Describe script te_log_message in details: which symbols are
prohibited in the message, how it's possible to dump files, etc.

RESULT
Additional review is necessary.

DIRECTION STATUS CHECKED
Use spell checker for the file.

DURECTION STATUS CHECKED
Limit line length by 80 symbols.

DIRECTION STATUS CHECKED
Line 40: wrong order of macro parameters (old note!)

DIRECTION STATUS CHECKED
Line 42: change log_mess to log_message (old note!)

DIRECTION STATUS CHECKED
Describe additional format specifier in description of LOG macro (old note!)

QUESTION STATUS CHECKED
Could the LOG macro be used with two arguments only?

DIRECTION STATUS CHECKED
C function and script logger_flush (with TA name as parameter) is necessary 
for using by TEN applications.

DIRECTION STATUS CHECKED
Log level-related macros should be defined (old note!)

DIRECTION STATUS CHECKED
Line 136: clarify how exectly the name is returned (printed to stdout?)

DIRECTION STATUS CHECKED
Line 139: unclear statement

DIRECTION STATUS CHECKED
Lines 131, 136: space is missed

DIRECTION STATUS CHECKED
Line 144, 149: wrong English

PROPOSAL STATUS CHECKED
Line 151: double quoting does not save from $ extensions. May be it's
better to just say that user is responsible for passing MESSAGE_STRING
as a single string from shell point of view and may use single quotes
and double quotes for this, if necessary.

RESULT
Additional review is necessary.
