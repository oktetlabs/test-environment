QUESTION
The document does not comply to DDR - TA side should provide
generic (not only network) interface to user. I.e. all prefixes
should be rcf_comm_agent_* and parameters of functions should be
generic. It is possible because we can link to TA only one communication
library and due this fact all functions from two TA communication libraries
may have same names. Another situation is on the TEN - several
communication libraries may be linked to RCF application and therefore
all libraries should have different interface. Moreover it's not
necessary to provide unified interface to TEN communication libraries -
we can do it most comfortable for communication library implementor.

RESULT
Document should be significantly updated - additional review is necessary.
