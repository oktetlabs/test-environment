DIRECTION
Chapter 11.1.3: Dispatcher dous not decide that "enough tests have been run".
It may know only when all tests are finished. In the first release
tce_flush will be called before TA reboot or shutdown only (TA shutdown
is performed when all tests are finished). It should call tce_flush
on the TA and call logger_flush to load raw log from TA to TEN.

In the future release separate script to be called by Tester subsystem
may be created to support TCE for particular Test Packages. It will
be called after tce_flush and should calculate and dump TCE results into 
the log and clean TCE data on the TA (moreover, it should save timestamp
of the last TCE message in the raw log to reject old messages in future).

DIRECTION
Line 182: it should be noted that tce_flush is called on the TA using RCF.

DIRECTION
Remove coveragelog_filename parameter.

Lines 273-277: remove.
