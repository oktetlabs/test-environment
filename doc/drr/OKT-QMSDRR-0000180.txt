DIRECTION STATUS FIXED
Must be clarified that when function(s) returns -1 the answer should be send
be caller (the function does nothing).

DIRECTION STATUS FIXED
Functions rcf_ch_start and rcf_ch_kill should be renamed to rcf_ch_task_start
and rcf_ch_task_kill

DIRECTION STATUS FIXED
Line 125 (the comments to the function rcf_ch_file). Comments should be 
changed -- command processing should be done by CALLER if -1 returned.

DIRECTION  STATUS FIXED
Line 314 (the comments to the function rcf_ch_call). "calls a routine 
rcf_ch_call_routine" is wrong (bad English).

RESULT
Document may be issued (approved) after notes processing during 20 minutes.
