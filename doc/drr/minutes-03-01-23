  The following items were adopted:

     1. Terminology must be in alphabetic order

     2. There must exist paths to packages;
        Or, in case, when user does not want to care about paths,
        there must be some default paths

        Conventions on paths:
                    if a paths starts with a slash, then it references
                    to the root (/), otherwise to $TESTBASE

     3. Defect numbers are deprecated

     4. Requirements can also be specified for scripts

     5. Keepalive - executed between tests to ensure the system is ok;
                    additionally, keepalive influences on the result of
                    the test (i.e. if it fails, the test is considered
                    failed).
                    My proposition: use keep-alive[e'laiv] instead of
                                    keep-a-live

     6. Change "noconfigure" to "configure",
               "nokeepalive" on "keepalive",
           so that
              noconfigure = "yes"  would change to configure = "no"
           and nokeepalive analogously

     7. Two approaches were argued about session:
           -- session is a subnode of "run"    [rybchik]
           -- session is a subnode of "script" [helen]

     8. Factual parameters should be called "var"
        Formal parameters = "arg"
