Document revised: Testing Environments Requirements Revision A
Participated: lvr, helen, arybchik, tema, oleg, konst, nicka, renata, ibr

Unfortunately I can't specify authors of notes, because
in most cases very hard discussion was, and it is not clear,
who may be considered as author. :)

1. The question was answered by helen about the best representation
of requirements (subsections and table) - from the reader and
writer point of view.

nicka: reader - subsections are better; writer - table is  better
other peolple (except lvr) - subsections are better from both points of view

2. Terminology

Term "TN" should be removed.
Term "TA" - Test Agent, entity running on NUT or another computers and
performing interaction with NUT, including configuration and
traffic sending/receiving, etc. according to TE commands.
Test Case should be defined.
Host and Target words should not be used.
Testing Environment definition should be changed (include framework,
documentation, etc.)
External Library definition should be clarified.

3. References should be moved to standards section (except ASN.1?).

4. Initial Conditions: items 8 and 10 of bulleted list should be removed.

5. 9.1.1.1: Item 2 of bulleted list should be clarified.

6. 9.1.1.2 "test suite" should be changed to "list of tests".
Requirement about error recovering should be the separate requirement.

7. 9.1.1.3: RS232 should be changed to "serial port". "Interaction"
should be changed to "NUT control using CLI". The same requirement for
TN should be specified.

8. 9.1.1.4: "kernel" should be changed to "bootable image".

9. 9.1.1.5: may be moved to 9.1.1.3 as clarification.

10. 9.1.1.6: should be removed. "Running test in debugging mode should
be supported." should appear instead.

11. 9.1.1.8: should be removed. Three another requirements should
be specified: TA should support several threads; it should be possible
to run test case in several threads; it should be possible tu run
several tests simultaneously in one test engine.

12. 9.1.1.9: should be splitted to several requirements about generic
log, log filtering, log format (universal format should be  designed
and used to generate another formats).

13. 9.1.1.10: time synchronization should be moved to requirement
about the protocol between TA and TE. Precise time obtaining should
be removed.

14. 9.1.1.11, 9.1.1.12
Overall system configuration should be accessible to
TE, TA and test suite. Initial (static part) and real (dynamic
part) of configuration database should be supported. All configuration
should be performed from test suite via TE only. It should be possible
to specify for an object (test or test suite) that TE should check,
that configuration is not changed by the object.

15. 9.1.1.14 Clarifications are required.

16. 9.1.1.17 "re-use" should be replaced by "perform".

17. 9.1.1.18 should be removed.

18. 9.1.1.20: "It should be possible to specify packets in the test
case in human-friendly form."

19. 9.1.1.22 should be removed (should appear in another place).

20. 9.1.2.1 should be removed.

21. 9.1.2.4 should be removed.

22. 9.1.2.5: Time synchronisation should be added. Should it be
moved to another place? (Is it marketing requirement or design
requirement?)

23. 9.1.4.2 Clarifications: word "testing" is missed.
