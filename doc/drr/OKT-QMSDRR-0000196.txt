DIRECTION STATUS FIXED
Remove Issue 1 - function for validation is necessary to log
incorrect test behaivour.

DIRECTION  STATUS FIXED
Remove Issue 2 - Configurator may create any histories. Human's command
"create history" should save compressed history during startup
and is used only to obtain Configurator configuration file (to reproduce
failure situation shortly).

DIRECTION  STATUS FIXED
General: check English gramma - there are too many wrong places (you
can ask Pasha Bolokhov to help).

QUESTION STATUS FIXED
Chapter 5: it's not clear how elements of the table on the one raw
are related. It's confusing a reader.

QUESTION
Is it efficient to store history and backup in files? May be some
representation in the memory is better?

QUESTION STATUS FIXED
Chapter 7: confusing statement "all commands passed via Configurator
are logged in the Configurator's history" - what about "get" commands?

PROPOSAL STATUS FIXED
Timestamp is confusing name for commands counter. It's better to find 
another name.

QUESTION STATUS FIXED
What happens with comands counter after backup restoring? Is it
assigned to t_back + 1?

DIRECTION STATUS FIXED.
Mention that TA running on the same station with TEN couldn't be rebooted.

RESULT
The document may be approved after notes processing if no significant 
changes are done.
