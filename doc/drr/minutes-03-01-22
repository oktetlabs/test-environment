Algorith of RC_S process functionality should be described.

Details should provided for understanding of layering (two layers)
for TE backend of the RC_S. (Specificity of some methods should
be marked).

Open issue: transfering of large amount of data through RC_S.

Problem with mixtured output (unparsable) from CLI should not
be considered.

It is suggested to use session mechanism for RC_S (instead 
of creation of instances for agents).

Possible problems due to threads and sockets (select)
are to be investigated by Oleg.
