Minutes of the "Test Environment Architecture" (revision B) discussion
Date: 2002.12.15; time: 17:32 - 19:21

General purpose of meeting was discussion of the document
        TS-OKT-0000021-TEARCH.

The following remarks and wishes were expressed.

This document will not be rewrited in new format.

Mention that TE consists from several processes(threads) - use general
term.

"Wit and charm" of the document are not to be discussed.

The first Picture is very complicated but necessary. Remove numbers.
Test may interact with "build sub." to obtain NUT code. The way of option
passing for build is an open issue.

Make "Figure #..." to be in a center.

"Storage" should be described as a separate module or ext lib(without
mentioning it in the Picture). Mentioning "Storage" in terminology is
required. All references to CVS must be replaced with a references to
"Storage"

1)..15):Who stops a process?
Committing should occur immediately after
building (if required).
e-mail delivery --> for ex. e-mail delivery. We must be more flexible.

6.
==
Describe debug, simultaneous and one-by-one modes.

"Oleg, do not spoil my brains!" - Helen.

Move "test param iteration" (from 6, documents) to the previous section.

Test subsistem works with "Set of tests", not with pakages. There is no
"pakage" from the point of view of Test subsistem. This issue must be
discussed tomorrow by Arybchik and Helen.


7.
==
Make debug and log level one of the "make" parameters.

8.
==
What is "test agent data"?
Lives in TE. Data about agent, not data inside the agent.

Some test pakages (may be tests too?) may change configuration.

10.
===
Remove all parameters in 10.1 (except CSAP creation) and make descriptions
more general. Add references to "responce" action. Add this action to the
picture.
