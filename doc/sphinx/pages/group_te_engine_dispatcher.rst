Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dispatcher is a subsystem providing a proper initialization and shutdown of the TEN subsystems. It prepares the environment (creates directories for temporary files, exports environment variables, etc.), initiates building, if necessary, and initializes TEN applications according to options provided on the command line.

From user point of view :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` is a BASH script that launches processes and TEN components according to specified command line options.

During its operation :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` sets a few environment variables among which the most important are:

* TE_BASE

  Location of Test Environment sources. If the Dispatcher script is called from the source directory, this variable is exported automatically. Otherwise if building is necessary (i.e., TE is not pre-installed), TE_BASE should be exported manually.

* TE_BUILD

  This variable is exported automatically unless already exported. It is set to a start directory (a directory from which the Dispatcher script is called) or, if a file configure.ac is present in the start directory, to the (created if needed) build subdirectory of the start directory: [start directory]/build.

* TE_INSTALL

  This variable is passed as the value of the prefix option to the main configure script. Moreover, its value is used when path variables for the search of headers and libraries are constructed. It may be set manually. If it is empty, it is set to the directory where the Dispatcher script is located (if the installed Dispatcher script is used) or to ${TE_BUILD}/inst (if the Dispatcher script from the source directory is used).

* TE_INSTALL_SUITE User may export this variable to specify the location of Test Suite executables (for :ref:`Builder <doxid-group__te__engine__builder>` and :ref:`Tester <doxid-group__te__engine__tester>`). If this variable is empty, it is set automatically to ${TE_INSTALL}/suites.

* TE_TMP

  This variable is set by :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` to [start directory]/te_tmp by default. However, if it's desirable to use some other directory for temporary files, it may be exported manually.

* LD_LIBRARY_PATH This variable is exported by :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` automatically and used for shared library search. It is set to ${TE_INSTALL}/[host platform]/lib.

* PATH

  Path to TEN executables is provided automatically by :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>`. It updates PATH variable by ${TE_INSTALL}/[host platform]/bin. Moreover, if scripts provided by :ref:`Logger <doxid-group__te__engine__logger>`, :ref:`Builder <doxid-group__te__engine__builder>` and storage library to :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` are not installed yet, :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` adds to PATH variable path to these scripts in the source directory.

* TE_LOG_DIR Directory to store log files. Usually set to TE_RUN_DIR which in it's turn is set to the current directory (PWD).

Start/stop sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sequence of events happen each time when you launch Test Environment with dispatcher.sh or run.sh script:

#. :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` script starts with some command line options (for more information on :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` options read :ref:`Dispatcher Command Line Options <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher_1te_engine_dispatcher_options>`);

#. :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` runs te_log_init script to initialize script based logging facility. All further actions can be logged via script based interface (te_log_message script). Please note that :ref:`Logger <doxid-group__te__engine__logger>` application hasn't started yet;

#. :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` starts :ref:`Builder <doxid-group__te__engine__builder>` to prepare libraries and executables for all TE Subsystems (except :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>`), Test Packages, te_agents and bootable NUT image(s).  te_engine_builder is passed a configuration file that describes a set of executables to be built with a set of options for building process.

   :ref:`Builder <doxid-group__te__engine__builder>` configuration file name specified via conf-builder option of :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>`.

   (For information about :ref:`Builder <doxid-group__te__engine__builder>` configuration file read :ref:`Builder configuration file <doxid-group__te__engine__builder_1te_engine_builder_conf_file>`).

   Please note that traces of building process are output into the console (they are not accumulated in log file);

#. As soon as :ref:`Builder <doxid-group__te__engine__builder>` successfully built and installed all required components, :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` starts launching :ref:`Test Engine <doxid-group__te__engine>` componentns. First component to start is :ref:`Logger <doxid-group__te__engine__logger>`. :ref:`Logger <doxid-group__te__engine__logger>` is passed a configuration file whose name can be specified via conf-logger :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` command line option (for information about the format of :ref:`Logger <doxid-group__te__engine__logger>` configuration file refer to :ref:`Configuration File <doxid-group__te__engine__logger_1te_engine_logger_conf_file>`).

   :ref:`Logger <doxid-group__te__engine__logger>` starts listening for incoming log requests that can come from tests and other TEN components;

#. :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` starts :ref:`Remote Control Facility (RCF) <doxid-group__te__engine__rcf>`. :ref:`Remote Control Facility (RCF) <doxid-group__te__engine__rcf>` is passed a configuration file that describes te_agents to be started (for information about the format of :ref:`Remote Control Facility (RCF) <doxid-group__te__engine__rcf>` configuration file refer to :ref:`RCF Configuration File <doxid-group__te__engine__rcf_1te_engine_rcf_conf_file>`).

   As a part of initialization :ref:`Remote Control Facility (RCF) <doxid-group__te__engine__rcf>` establishes communication with te_agents using Test Protocol;

#. As soon as :ref:`Remote Control Facility (RCF) <doxid-group__te__engine__rcf>` has initialized, :ref:`Logger <doxid-group__te__engine__logger>` starts a thread that is responsible for polling te_agents Test Agents in order to gather log messages accumulated on Test Agent side. Polling interval is configured via :ref:`Logger <doxid-group__te__engine__logger>` configuration file;

#. :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` starts :ref:`Configurator <doxid-group__te__engine__conf>`. :ref:`Configurator <doxid-group__te__engine__conf>` is passed a configuration file that describes configuration objects to register as well as object instances to add (for information about the format of :ref:`Configurator <doxid-group__te__engine__conf>` configuration file refer to :ref:`Configurator Configuration File <doxid-group__te__engine__conf_1te_engine_conf_file>`). On start-up :ref:`Configurator <doxid-group__te__engine__conf>` retrives configuration information from te_agents and initializes local trees of objects and instances;

#. :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` starts :ref:`Tester <doxid-group__te__engine__tester>`. :ref:`Tester <doxid-group__te__engine__tester>` processes configuration file and if necessary asks :ref:`Builder <doxid-group__te__engine__builder>` to build test suites (test executables). Then :ref:`Tester <doxid-group__te__engine__tester>` processes test package description files and runs tests in corresponding order and with specified set of parameter values. (For information about :ref:`Tester <doxid-group__te__engine__tester>` configuration file format refer to :ref:`Configuration File <doxid-group__te__engine__tester_1te_engine_tester_conf>` section).

   Before running tests, :ref:`Tester <doxid-group__te__engine__tester>` asks :ref:`Configurator <doxid-group__te__engine__conf>` to make a backup of configuration tree. When all tests are finished :ref:`Tester <doxid-group__te__engine__tester>` restores the initial configuration from initial backup. To prevent tests from interfering, a backup is created and optionally restored before each test as well.

#. When :ref:`Tester <doxid-group__te__engine__tester>` returns (all tests finished), :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` stops :ref:`Configurator <doxid-group__te__engine__conf>`;

#. Flushing of the log from all Test Agents is performed;

#. :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` stops :ref:`Remote Control Facility (RCF) <doxid-group__te__engine__rcf>`. During its shutdown, :ref:`Remote Control Facility (RCF) <doxid-group__te__engine__rcf>` performs a shutdown of all te_agents;

#. :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` stops :ref:`Logger <doxid-group__te__engine__logger>`. :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` calls Report Generator tool to convert the log from a raw format to the text and/or HTML format;

#. :ref:`Dispatcher <doxid-group__te__engine__dispatcher>` script finishes its work.

	Environment variables defining where raw log is stored:
	
	
	.. code-block:: c
	
		TE_LOG_RAW          Where to save raw log file, by default tmp_raw_log
		                    in directory specified by --log-dir (if provided)
		                    or in the current directory.
		TE_LOG_BUNDLE       Where to save raw log bundle (tarball compressed
		                    with pixz). If it is not set, raw log bundle is not
		                    created.
		
		The script exits with a status of zero if everything does smoothly and
		all tests, if any tests are run, give expected results. A status of two
		is returned, if some tests are run and give unexpected results.
		A status of one indicates start up or any internal failure.
