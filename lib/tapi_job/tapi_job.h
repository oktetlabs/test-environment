 * the methods to create and control jobs on a specific Test Agent.
 *
 * When factory is created by tapi_job_factory_rpc_create(), the job
 * instances are created on the specified RPC server and are controlled
 * by the facility that is set up on the RPC server.
 *
 * When factory is created by tapi_job_factory_cfg_create(), the job
 * instances are controlled by "/agent/process" Configurator subtree.
 *
 * Job factory API allows tapi_job_create() API to be independent from
 * a particular implementation of job control. It makes any other
 * programming logic that is build on tapi_job functionality fully
 * decoupled from job control backend. To achieve this, e.g. an API
 * should not use tapi_job_factory* create, but consume already created
 * factory to create jobs inside the API. The user of such an API will
 * decide which job control implementation to choose.
