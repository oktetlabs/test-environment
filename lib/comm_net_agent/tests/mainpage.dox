<!--

@tdt_start

@tdt_term Network Communication Library, Agent/Engine
@tdt_def Communication library which performs low-level transmission
         of the Test Protocol commands. Library exists separately
         for the Agent and for the Engine.
@tdt_term Local Station
@tdt_def The executable binary running on a station on which the communication
         library is being tested. 
@tdt_term Remote Station
@tdt_def The executable binary running on a (possibly a different from the 
         local) station which behaves like a dummy Test Engine which sends
         probe commands to the Local Station and receives replies from it.

@section introduction Introduction

<!--
  - Provide introductory descriptive information about context and
  - purpose of the document, allowing reader to better understand
  - its meaning.
  -
  - Identify test plan document, if it exists, in which conditions this
  - specification was written.
  -
  - Any general information, which should be provided before another
  - sections, may be written here.
  -
  - State briefly what this Test Specification covers.
  -->
This document lists the features of Network Communication Library/Agent that
are tested and the way they are tested. It gives some advices how to
configure the test setup. 


@subsection constrains What is tested and will not be tested

<!--
  - List identifiers of the requirements directly verified by this Test
  - Specification. If requirement is partly tested, mark out the aspects
  - to be verified by this Test Specification and not to be verified.
  - Try to provide reasons why some aspect/feature is not tested.
  -->
TE-0023-DSGN Requirement:
    A single Protocol to be used between Test Engine and all Test Agents should
    be specified and implemented. It should include time synchronization.

In fact, only the interoperability of the network transport which ships the protocol
messages and commands is tested. No features of the protocol itself are tested.
Nor is the time synchronization tested.

 
@subsection quality_goals Quality goals

<!--
  - Specify the quality goals:
  -  - code coverage (in percents);
  -  - compatibility;
  -  - reliability in normal use;
  -  - boundary value testing;
  -  - robustness under stress;
  -  - performance.
  -->
The reliability of the Agent part's Network Communication Library is tested.

Some boundary tests are provided. Also, some tests perform checks on transmission of large
buffers. API sanity checks testing is also done.

<!-- The last two subsections may be omitted for black box testing. -->


@subsection environmental_requirements Environmental Requirements

<!--
  - Specify configuration(s) necessary to use this Test Specification.
  -
  - If different configurations are necessary for different tests,
  - it's recommended to describe all configurations here and structure
  - tests by used configuration. Also it's possible to describe
  - configurations in the package description file, if many
  - configurations must be tested with small number of tests for each
  - configuration.
  -
  - Also static target configuration (software) must be described here.
  -
  - In fact it's rarely when each test uses all configuration items.
  - Hence some of them may be marked as optional with AC-ER-<number>
  - identifier to be referenced from detailed description of packages
  - and tests.
  -->
  For testing the Agent's Network Communication Library, a remote station
which would pretend to be the Engine, is needed. This station sends TP commands
and receives Agent's replies. 

  Due to the necessity of having a remote station, the number of tests in fact
double -- local tests encourage the library to perform some actions while remote
tests communicate with the library and check the data they receive. This requires
synchronization between the two test parts: the remote part needs to know when
to start sending or listening, and it needs to know the correct data that has been
sent via the library, in order to check the correctness of the data it receives.
This requires creating a separate data channel which would carry the correct data from
the library side tests to the remote station. And these necessities complexify the 
test functionality. 

But as a matter of fact, given that the communication between the Agent and the 
Engine uses TCP sockets, the test setup can be simplified: each test can perform 
the very same actions which in the described above approach the remote station would.
A test can connect to the library (being aware of the port and address where to connect, or
at which to listen) and perform the necessary library API manipulations simultaneously. 
Comparison of buffers would be much more trivial: no parallel network connection is required. 
And time synchronization is trivial.

Finally note, that the library can be compiled standalone and no initial pre-setup for 
the tests needs to be performed. The only requirement is that the library exist and 
be compiled.
