/** @file
 * @brief Logger subsystem API - TA side 
 *
 * API provided by Logger subsystem to users on TA side.
 * Set of macros provides compete functionality for debugging
 * and tracing and highly recommended for using in the source
 * code. 
 *
 * There are facilities for both fast and slow  logging. 
 * Fast logging(LOGF_... macros) does not copy
 * bytes arrays and strings into local log buffer. Only start 
 * memory address and length of dumped memory are regestered.
 * So, user has to take care about validity of logged data 
 * (logged data should not be volatile).
 * Slow logging (LOGS_... macros) parses log message format string
 * and copy dumped memory and strings into local log buffer and user 
 * has not to take care about validity of logged data.
