@section te_agent_unix_introduction Introduction

The most functional and frequently used agent type is UNIX Agent.
Even though it tends to be generic UNIX Agent, it is better adapted
for Linux OS.

Sources of UNIX Test Agent can be found under @path{agents/unix}
directory of TE tree.

Unix Test Egent supports the following features:
- RPC Server functionality;
- Process/thread creation feature;
- Rich configuration tree support:
- Daemons configuration
  (dhcp, dns, ldap, pppoe, radius, radvd, vtund, 802.1x supplicants);
- Sniffer support;
- Control of Power Switch devices;
- Traffic Application Domain (TAD) support for network protocols
  (ARP, ATM, DHCP, Ethernet, IGMP, UDP, TCP, IPv4, ICMPv4,
  IPv6, ICMPv6, PPP, SNMP, iSCSI);
- Automatic configuration server (ACS) engine
  for testing TR-069 specification.
